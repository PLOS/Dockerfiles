<h2>Brief Overview for <em>PLOS ONE</em> Reviewers</h2>
<ul>
  <li>If you have been invited to review a submission to <em>PLOS ONE</em> then please consult this 2 minute <a
    href="http://blogs.plos.org/everyone/2011/05/10/how-to-accept-or-decline-an-invitation-to-review-a-manuscript/">video</a>
    which explains how to accept or decline the invitation.
  </li>
  <li>Then please carefully study our seven <a href="publication.action">Editorial Criteria for Publication</a> as the
    criteria employed by <em>PLOS ONE</em> are quite different to other journals you may have reviewed for.
  </li>
</ul>


<a name="about" id="about"></a>
<h2>1. About <em>PLOS ONE</em></h2>
<p>Scientific progress requires the exchange and discussion of data and ideas. <em>PLOS ONE</em> is a unique publication
  dedicated to presenting the results of scientific research from any scientific or medical discipline in an open-access
  environment. At the same time, it provides a forum in which to discuss that research and so provide for each and every
  paper its maximum possible impact. To achieve this, <em>PLOS ONE</em> combines traditional peer review with 'Web 2.0'
  tools to facilitate community evaluation and discourse around the published article.</p>

<p>The peer review of each article is rigorous and concentrates on objective and technical concerns to determine whether
  the research has been sufficiently well conceived, well executed, and well described to justify inclusion in the
  scientific record. Then, after publication, all articles are opened up for interactive discussions and assessment in
  which the whole scientific community can be involved. </p>

<p>Unlike many journals which attempt to use the peer review process to determine whether or not an article reaches the
  level of 'importance' required by a given journal, <em>PLOS ONE</em> uses peer review to determine whether a paper is
  technically sound and worthy of inclusion in the published scientific record. Once the work is published in <em>PLOS
    ONE</em>, the broader community is then able to discuss and evaluate the significance of the article (through the
  number of citations it attracts; the downloads it achieves; the media and blog coverage it receives; and the
  post-publication Notes, Comments and Ratings that it receives on <em>PLOS ONE</em> etc).</p>

<p>To provide open access, PLOS journals use a business model in which our expenses&#8212;including those of peer
  review, journal production, and online hosting and archiving&#8212;are recovered in part by charging a publication fee
  to the authors or research sponsors for each article they publish. For <em>PLOS ONE</em> the publication fee is
  US$1350. Authors who are affiliated with one of our <a href="http://www.plos.org/support/instmembers.html"
                                                         title="PLOS.org | Institutional Members">Institutional
    Members</a> are eligible for a discount on this fee.</p>

<p>We also have a fee waiver policy for authors who do not have funds to cover publication fees. Editors and reviewers
  have no access to payment information, and hence ability to pay will not influence publication decisions. These
  policies ensure that the fee is never a barrier to publication.</p>

<p>Please see our <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/everyone/qa/">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</a> page for detailed
  information on common editorial inquiries.</p>


<a name="criteria" id="criteria"></a>
<h2>2. Criteria for Publication</h2>


<p>To be accepted for publication in <em>PLOS ONE</em>, research articles must satisfy the following criteria:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The study presents the results of primary scientific research.</li>
  <li>Results reported have not been published elsewhere.</li>
  <li>Experiments, statistics, and other analyses are performed to a high technical standard and are described in
    sufficient detail.
  </li>
  <li>Conclusions are presented in an appropriate fashion and are supported by the data.</li>
  <li>The article is presented in an intelligible fashion and is written in standard English.</li>
  <li>The research meets all applicable standards for the ethics of experimentation and research integrity.</li>
  <li>The article adheres to appropriate reporting guidelines and community standards for data availability.</li>
</ol>
<p>The <a href="edboard.action" title="PLOS ONE edboard"><em>PLOS ONE</em> board of Academic Editors</a>, and any
  invited external peer reviewers, will evaluate submissions against these criteria.</p>

<p>To expand on each of these criteria:</p>

<h3>1. Does the manuscript report on primary research?</h3>

<p><em>PLOS ONE</em> is designed specifically as a medium for primary, scientific research. As such, it is not suitable
  for the publication of reviews, mini-reviews, opinion pieces, commentaries, essays or other items of secondary
  literature (unless invited for a specific purpose by PLOS staff).</p>

<p>Systematic reviews and meta-analyses can be considered for publication in <em>PLOS ONE</em> but must apply the utmost
  rigour in the comprehensive and unbiased sampling of existing literature and must describe the methods used for the
  selection, inclusion and exclusion of data (see below). </p>

<p>Individual case reports are not considered for publication in <em>PLOS ONE.</em> However, papers describing the
  results of studies involving only one individual (ie, n-of-1 studies) can be considered for publication in <em>PLOS
    ONE</em> if evidence is provided that the paper describes the results of a preplanned research project, rather than
  a description of the clinical care received by an individual patient.</p>

<h3>2. Have the results reported been published elsewhere? </h3>

<p><em>PLOS ONE</em> does not accept for publication work that has already been published elsewhere. However, studies
  that replicate results that are already in the literature may be considered for publication in <em>PLOS ONE</em>, as
  the independent confirmation of results can often be valuable, as can the presentation of a new dataset (for example,
  a new clinical trial).</p>

<h3>3. Are the experiments, statistics, and other analyses performed to a high technical standard and are described in
  sufficient detail? </h3>

<p>The research must have been performed to a technical standard high enough to allow robust conclusions to be drawn
  from the data. Methods and reagents must also be described in sufficient detail so that another researcher is able to
  reproduce the experiments described. </p>


<h3>4. Are the conclusions presented in an appropriate fashion with speculations and hypotheses identified as such?</h3>

<p>The results must be interpreted appropriately, such that all conclusions are justified. However, authors may discuss
  possible explanations for their results as long as these are clearly identified as speculations or hypotheses, rather
  than as firm conclusions. Inappropriate interpretation of results is a justifiable reason for rejection.</p>

<h3>5. Is the article presented in an intelligible fashion and written in English?</h3>

<p><em>PLOS ONE</em> staff do not copyedit the text of accepted manuscripts; it is therefore important for the work, as
  presented, to be intelligible. Perfect, stylish English is not essential but the language must be clear and
  unambiguous. If the language of a paper is poor, Academic Editors should recommend that authors seek independent
  editorial help before submission of a revision. Poor presentation and language is a justifiable reason for rejection.
</p>

<h3>6. Does the research meet all applicable standards with regard to the ethics of experimentation and research
  integrity? </h3>

<p>Research published in <em>PLOS ONE</em> must have been conducted to the highest ethical standards. A brief
  description of the most common of these is described in our <a href="policies.action#reporting">Editorial and
    Publishing Policies</a>. Please contact <em>PLOS ONE</em> staff (<strong>plosone [at] plos.org</strong>) if you have
  queries as to whether these standards have been met. </p>

<h3>7. Does the article adhere to appropriate reporting guidelines and community standards for data availability?</h3>

<p><em>PLOS ONE</em> aims to promote openness in research and intends that all work published in <em>PLOS ONE</em> can
  be built on by future researchers. We therefore demand conformity to standards for the public deposition of data (for
  example gene sequences, microarray expression data, and structural studies). Other similar standards that are
  applicable to specific communities should also be upheld. Failure to comply with community standards is a justifiable
  reason for rejection. Authors should consult our editorial policies <a
    href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#reporting">(http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#reporting)</a>,
  and the EQUATOR website <a href="http://www.equator-network.org/">(http://www.equator-network.org/)</a> for
  information about the guidelines and standards that apply to their study.  </em>


  <a name="process" id="process"></a>
<h2>3. Overview of the Editorial Process</h2>
<p><em>PLOS ONE</em> will provide all authors with an efficient and "hassle-free" editorial process. Our aim is to
  identify those submissions that warrant inclusion in the scientific record and present them to the scientific
  community with as few hurdles as possible. </p>
<p>The editorial process is run by the journal's extensive <a href="edboard.action"
                                                              title="PLOS ONE | Advisory and Editorial Boards">board of
  Academic Editors</a> (AEs) who work together to orchestrate the peer-review process. AEs are invited to handle
  submitted manuscripts on the basis of the content of the manuscript and their own expertise. The AE evaluates the
  paper and decides whether it describes a body of work that meets the editorial criteria of <em>PLOS ONE</em>. AEs can
  employ a variety of methods, alone or in combination, to reach a decision in which they are confident:</p>

<ul>
  <li>They can conduct the peer review themselves, based on their own knowledge and experience</li>
  <li>They can take further advice through discussion with other members of the editorial board</li>
  <li>They can solicit reports from further referees</li>
</ul>
<p>After appropriate consideration by the AE, a decision letter to the author is drafted. This letter may also be
  circulated to other members of the editorial board, who are given a short time to comment on the editorial
  decision. </p>
<p>There are several types of decisions possible: </p>
<ul>

  <li>Accept in principle</li>
  <li>Minor revision</li>
  <li>Major revision</li>
  <li>Reject</li>
</ul>
<p>Upon acceptance, the manuscript is checked by <em>PLOS ONE</em> staff to ensure that it is in a form that will allow
  it to be efficiently handled by our production system. The authors will be queried and allowed to make any final minor
  revisions that are needed.</p>

<p>This is the final stage at which authors will see their manuscript before publication. The authors' files will be
  carefully tagged to generate XML and PDF files, but will not be subject to detailed copyediting (see <a
    href="guidelines.action#production" title="PLOS ONE | Authors Guidelines">Overview of the Production Process</a>).
  It is therefore essential that authors provide a thoroughly proofread and checked manuscript, following the author
  checklist and any comments from PLOS staff.</p>

<a name="selection" id="selection"></a>
<h2>4. Reviewer Selection</h2>
<p>Selection of reviewers for a particular manuscript is the responsibility of the AE and is based on many factors,
  including expertise, reputation, specific recommendations of authors and academic editors, and the AE's own knowledge
  of a reviewer's past performance.</p>
<p>As part of our editorial procedure, we confer with potential reviewers before sending them manuscripts to review.
  Reviewers should bear in mind that even these initial messages or conversations contain confidential information,
  which should be regarded as such.</p>

<a name="reviewer" id="reviewer"></a>
<h2>5. Using the Reviewer Form</h2>


<p><em>PLOS ONE</em> reviewers are asked to complete a structured reviewer form which aims to help reviewers focus on
  the <em>PLOS ONE</em> publication criteria and improve the efficiency of the peer review process. </p>

<p>Reviewers may preview the full form <a
  href="http://plosone-stage.plos.org/static/reviewerForm.action#reviewer">here</a>.</p>

<p>The form consists of three sections:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Statement of Competing Interests (required)</b></li>
</ul>

<p>Reviewers must declare any potential or perceived <a href="http://www.plosone.org/static/editorial.action#competing">competing
  interests</a> that may influence their review.</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Comments to the Author (required)</b></li>
</ul>

<p>This section includes questions about whether the submission meets the <em>PLOS ONE</em> publication criteria. </p>

<p>The required questions are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Answer options: Yes, No, Partly</li>
  </ul>

  <li>Has the statistical analysis been performed appropriately and rigorously?</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Answer options: Yes, No, I don’t know, N/A</li>
  </ul>

  <li>Does the manuscript adhere to standards in this field for data availability?</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Answer options: Yes, No</li>
  </ul>

  <li>Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Answer options: Yes, No</li>
  </ul>

</ol>


<p>If the reviewer has further feedback about a specific item, it may be included in the optional free-text box
  following the question. </p>

<p>Reviewers may also raise any additional issues in a free-text response at the end of the form. This question is
  optional.</p>

<p>The answers to all questions in this section will be included in the decision letter to the author.</p>

<p>There is also a space for reviewers to sign their name if they would like their identity to be revealed to the
  authors and other reviewers. <em>PLOS ONE</em> encourages transparency in peer review. </p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Confidential Comments to the Editor (optional)</b></li>
</ul>

<p> In this section, reviewers may share any comments with the Academic Editor that they do not wish to share with the
  author. This section is optional, and we strongly encourage reviewers to include all feedback about the scientific
  content of the manuscript in the "Comments to the Author" section. However, we understand that it may not be
  appropriate to share some comments with the authors. </p>

<p>This section also includes two optional questions about whether the submission should be highlighted on the <em>PLOS
  ONE</em> webpage. These questions are part of our effort to develop tools like <a
  href="http://www.plosone.org/static/almInfo.action">article-level metrics</a> to highlight specific content. These
  answers will not play any role in the editorial decision-making process and will not be shared with the authors. </p>


<a name="confidentiality" id="confidentiality"></a>
<h2>6. Confidentiality</h2>
<p>The review process is strictly confidential and should be treated as such by reviewers. As the author may have chosen
  to exclude some people from this process, no one who is not directly involved with the manuscript (including
  colleagues and other experts in the field) should be consulted by the reviewer unless such consultations have first
  been discussed with the Academic Editor. Reviewers must not take any confidential information they have gained in the
  review process and use it before the paper is published. Even after publication, unless they have the permission of
  the authors to use other information, reviewers may only use publicly published data (i.e. the contents of the
  published article) and not information from any earlier drafts.</p>

<a name="timely" id="timely"></a>
<h2>7. Timely Review</h2>
<p><em>PLOS ONE</em> believes that an efficient editorial process that results in timely publication provides a valuable
  service both to authors and to the scientific community at large.</p>

<a name="anonymity" id="anonymity"></a>
<h2>8. Anonymity</h2>
<p>Although reviewers may remain anonymous during the review process, we strongly urge them to relinquish this anonymity
  to promote open and transparent decision-making.</p>

<a name="editing" id="editing"></a>
<h2>9. Editing Reviewers' Reports</h2>
<p>The editors and PLOS staff do not edit any comments made by reviewers that have been intended to be read by the
  authors unless the language is deemed inappropriate for professional communication or the comments contain information
  considered confidential. Such remarks should be reserved for the confidential section of the review form, which is
  intended to be read by the editors only. In their comments to authors, reviewers are encouraged to be honest but not
  offensive in their language. On the other hand, authors should not confuse frank and perhaps even robust language with
  unfair criticism.</p>

<a name="competing" id="competing"></a>
<h2>10. Competing Interests</h2>
<p>As far as possible, we respect requests by authors to exclude reviewers whom they consider to be unsuitable. We also,
  as much as possible, try to rule out those reviewers who may have an obvious competing interest, such as those who may
  have been collaborators on other projects with the authors of this manuscript, those who may be direct competitors,
  those who may have a known history of antipathy with the author(s), or those who might profit financially from this
  work. Because it is not possible for all such competing interests to be known by a particular editor, we request that
  reviewers who recognize a potential competing interest inform the editors or journal staff and recuse themselves if
  they feel that are unable to offer an impartial review.</p>

<p>Read more about the <a href="competing.action" title="PLOS ONE | Competing Interests Policy">policy of PLOS regarding
  competing interests</a>. When submitting your review, you must indicate in the box provided whether or not you have
  any competing interests.
  On occasion, reviewers may be asked to offer their opinion on a manuscript that they may have reviewed for some other
  journal. This is not in itself a competing interest. That two journals have identified the same person as especially
  well qualified to judge the manuscript under consideration does not in any way decrease the validity of that opinion
  and may perhaps even enhance it.</p>

<a name="feedback" id="feedback"></a>
<h2>11. Feedback to Reviewers</h2>
<p>We send reviewers' comments along with the decision letter to reviewers of that manuscript. If reviewers have
  identified themselves, this information will be passed on to other reviewers. Reviewers who may have offered an
  opinion not in accordance with the final decision should not feel that their recommendation was not duly considered
  and their service not properly appreciated. Experts often disagree, and it is the job of the editorial team to make a
  decision.</p>

<a name="sharing" id="sharing"></a>
<h2>12. Sharing Reviews with Other PLOS Journals</h2>
<p>PLOS publishes several journals. Occasionally, editors recommend after peer review that a particular article is more
  suitable for another PLOS journal. If the authors choose to pursue that option, we transfer the manuscript and the
  reviews to the other journal. We expect that reviewers for any PLOS journal are willing to have their reviews
  considered by the editors of another PLOS journal.</p>
