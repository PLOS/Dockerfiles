  <h1><em>PLOS ONE</em> Reviewer Form</h1>

  <p><em>PLOS ONE</em> is implementing a new structured reviewer form on December 13th. This form aims to help reviewers
    focus on the <em>PLOS ONE</em> <a href="publication">publication criteria</a> and improve the efficiency of the peer
    review process. </p>

  <p>You can see the full form at the bottom of this page. It consists of three sections:</p>

  <ol><b>
    <li>Statement of Competing Interests (required)</li>
  </b>


    <p>Reviewers must declare any potential or perceived <a href="editorial#competing">competing interests</a> that may
      influence their review.</p>

    <b>
      <li>Comments to the Author (required)</li>
    </b>

    <p>This section includes questions about whether the submission meets the <em>PLOS ONE</em> publication criteria.
      Answers to these questions are required. Reviewers also have the opportunity to raise any additional issues in a
      free-text response at the end of the form. This question is optional.</p>

    <p>The answers to all questions in this section will be included in the decision letter to the author.</p>

    <p>The specific questions in this section focus on the:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="publication#technical">Technical soundness</a> of the work</li>
      <li><a href="publication#data%20support">Rigor of the analysis</a></li>
      <li>Adherence to <a href="publication#data%20report">data sharing standards</a></li>
      <li>Clarity of the <a href="publication#language">English language usage</a></li>
      <li>Adherence to <em>PLOS ONE</em> standards for <a href="publication#ethical">research ethics</a> and <a
        href="publication#results">dual publication</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>For each of these questions, reviewers must choose between a selection of answer choices (e.g. "Yes", "No", "I
      don't know", "N/A"). If the reviewer has further feedback about a specific item, it may be included in the
      optional free-text box following the question. </p>

    <b>
      <li>Confidential Comments to the Editor (optional)</li>
    </b>

    <p>In this section, reviewers may share any comments with the Academic Editor that they do not wish to share with
      the author. This section is optional, and we strongly encourage reviewers to include all relevant information
      regarding their evaluation of the scientific content of the manuscript in the "Comments to the Author" section.
      However, we understand that some feedback that may be helpful to the Academic Editor may not be appropriate to
      share with the authors. </p>

    <p>This section also includes two optional questions about whether the submission should be highlighted on the <em>PLOS
      ONE</em> webpage. These questions are part of our effort to develop tools like <a href="almInfo">article-level
      metrics</a> to highlight specific content. These answers will not play any role in the editorial decision-making
      process and will not be shared with the authors. </p>
