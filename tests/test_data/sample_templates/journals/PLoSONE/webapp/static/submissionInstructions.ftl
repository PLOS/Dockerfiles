  <h2>2. Submission Instructions</h2>

  <p>These are step-by-step instructions for submitting a manuscript to our <a
    href="http://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/default.asp">online submission system</a>. We recommend that you keep
    this page open for your reference as you move through the submission process.</p>

  <p>Do <b>not</b> follow these instructions if you are resubmitting a revised manuscript, are responding to a technical
    check inquiry, or have otherwise already submitted this paper to <i>PLOS ONE</i>.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Begin.</strong> Go to <a href="http://www.editorialmanager.com/pone">Editorial Manager</a> and log in.
    </li>

    <li><strong>Submit new manuscript.</strong> Click on the "Submit New Manuscript" link under the "New Submissions"
      heading. This will take you to a new screen.
    </li>

    <li><strong>Article Type.</strong> Next, select your article type. Most submissions will be either a Research
      Article or a Clinical Trial.
    </li>

    <li><strong>Title.</strong> Enter the title and short title of your manuscript. Please do not enter your titles in
      all capital letters.
    </li>

    <li><strong>Contributors.</strong> Next you will be asked to enter the names, email addresses, and institutional
      affiliations for each author. Each author should have made real and concrete contributions to the manuscript; you
      will have the opportunity to describe each author's contribution in a further step. Each author should also be
      aware of the paper submission and approve the manuscript submitted. PLOS does not condone or accept guest
      authorship. See the <a href="editorial#authorship"><i>PLOS ONE</i> Editorial Policies</a> for more information
      about authorship.
    </li>

    <li><strong>Corresponding Author.</strong> Additionally, you will be asked to designate one author to act as
      corresponding author. Note that this is the person who will receive correspondence from the <i>PLOS ONE</i>
      editorial office, but does <b>not</b> need to be the person who will appear as corresponding author on the paper
      if accepted. The corresponding author is responsible for ensuring that the author list and author contributions
      are accurate and complete. The person noted as the corresponding author should be the person who is actually
      responsible for ensuring that all the proper forms are submitted and accurate, and should be readily available for
      correspondence if <i>PLOS ONE</i> editors have questions or concerns. If a corresponding author will not be
      available for an extended period of time, s/he should inform <i>PLOS ONE</i> at <b>plosone [at] plos.org</b>.
    </li>

    <li><strong>Category.</strong> Next, you'll receive a prompt about your paper's Section/Category. If your paper
      describes primary research on human subjects, indicate that here by selecting the category Clinical; if not,
      select Other.
    </li>

    <li><strong>Abstract.</strong> This should <b>exactly</b> match the text of the Abstract in your manuscript file.
    </li>

    <li><strong>Keywords.</strong> These will help expedite the internal processing of your manuscript. You will not
      have another opportunity to edit these, so please make sure to add concise, accurate keywords at this point.
    </li>

    <li><strong>Classifications.</strong> Next, you will be prompted to classify your manuscript by selecting terms from
      a classification tree. Please add as many accurate classifications as possible; this will help to speed up the
      process of matching your paper to an appropriate editor. For more details, watch this <a
        href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADSIJXHMJ08&feature=player_embedded">short video</a>.
    </li>

    <li><strong>Competing Interests.</strong> Please declare any affiliations or relationships that could be viewed as

        ONE</i> Editorial Policies</a> for more information about declaring competing interests.

      or preparation of the manuscript."

      ethics statement in the body of your paper; we recommend that you cut and paste your paper's ethics statement into
      this field. The information submitted here will be evaluated by the <i>PLOS ONE</i> editors to ensure that it
