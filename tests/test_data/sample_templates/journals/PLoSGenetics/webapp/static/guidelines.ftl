<a name="about"></a>
<h2>1. About <em>PLOS Genetics</em></h2>
<p>The techniques of genetics and genomics are being applied to a wealth of biological questions and experimental
  systems. <em>PLOS Genetics</em> reflects the full breadth and interdisciplinary nature of this research by publishing
  outstanding original contributions in all areas of biology. With immediate free access to all content, <em>PLOS
    Genetics</em> provides a unique venue for publishing genetics and genomics research, ensuring that authors reach the
  widest possible audience.</p>

<p><em>PLOS Genetics</em> publishes human studies as well as research on model organisms&mdash;from mice and flies, to
  plants and bacteria. Our emphasis is on studies of broad interest that provide significant mechanistic insight into a
  biological process or processes. Topics include (but are not limited to) gene discovery and function, population
  genetics, genome projects, comparative and functional genomics, medical genetics, disease biology, evolution, gene
  expression, complex traits, chromosome biology, and epigenetics. Please consult our <a href="faq.action">Frequently
    Asked Questions</a> for further information.</p>

<a name="openaccess"></a>
<h2>2. Open Access</h2>
${open_access}

<a name="publicationcharges"></a>
<h2>3. Publication Charges</h2>
${publication_charges}


<a name="criteria"></a>
<h2>4. Criteria for Publication</h2>

<p>To be considered for publication in <em>PLOS Genetics</em>, any given manuscript must satisfy the following criteria:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Originality</li>
  <li>High importance to researchers in the field</li>
  <li>Broad interest to researchers in genetics and genomics</li>
  <li>Rigorous methodology</li>
  <li>Substantial evidence for its conclusions</li>
</ul>

<a name="editorial"></a>
<h2>5. Overview of Editorial Process</h2>
<p>Our aim is to provide all authors with an efficient, courteous, and constructive editorial process. To achieve its
  required level of quality, <em>${journal_name}</em> is highly selective in the manuscripts that it publishes;
  rejection rates are high. To ensure the fairest and most objective decision-making, the editorial process is run as a
  partnership between the <em>${journal_name}</em> <a href="eic.action">Editor-in-Chief</a>, a Deputy Editor, a team of
  Section Editors (SEs), and a group of academic experts who act as <a href="edboard.action">Associate Editors</a>
  (AEs). These individuals are leaders in their fields and represent the full breadth of genetics and genomics.</p>

<p>Submitted manuscripts are first reviewed by the EIC, Deputy Editor, or one of the SEs, who may decide to reject the
  paper or send it on to an AE for further review. The AE is most often a member of the <em>${journal_name}</em>
  Editorial Board, but occasionally a guest of the Board is invited to serve in this capacity. The AE evaluates the
  paper and decides whether it describes a sufficient body of work to support a major advance in a particular field. If
  so, the paper is sent out for external peer review, at which stage the technical and scientific merits of the work are
  carefully considered. Once the reviews have been received and considered by the editors, a decision letter to the
  corresponding author is drafted and sent.</p>


<p>The decision will be within one of the following categories:
<ul>
  <li>Reject</li>
  <li>Major revision</li>
  <li>Minor revision</li>
  <li>Accept</li>
</ul>
</p>


<a name="presubs"></a>
<h2>6. Presubmission Inquiries</h2>
<p>When authors are unsure whether their work satisfies the basic requirements for publication in
  <em>${journal_name}</em>, we are happy to consider presubmission inquiries. If you would like to submit an informal
  presubmission inquiry to see if a manuscript is appropriate in principle, please login or register for a new account
  within our <a href="${jms_link}">online submission system</a>, and then submit your query by choosing 'Presubmission
  Inquiry' from the list of article types. Required for all Presubmission Inquiries are contact information, a cover
  letter, and an abstract.</p>

<p>Responses to these inquiries are normally provided within a few working days. Responses may take longer if
  consultation between members of the editorial board is required. If you are invited to <a href="${jms_link}">submit
    your manuscript</a>, we will do our best to provide an expeditious initial assessment of the complete manuscript for
  suitability and then, if warranted, external peer review.</p>

<a name="preparation"></a>
<h2>7. Preparation of Research Manuscripts</h2>
<p><em>PLOS Genetics</em> publishes original research that
  clearly demonstrates novelty, importance to a particular field,
  biological significance, and conclusions that are justified by
  the study.</p>

</p>Our aim is to make the editorial process rigorous and
consistent, and to offer the best possible support to our authors
throughout this process. Authors are encouraged to decide how
best to present their ideas, results, and conclusions, but all
research should be presented in a form that is readable to those
in the field, easily understood by scientists outside of the
immediate discipline, and comprehensible to readers whose first
language is not English. The writing style should therefore be
concise and accessible. Care should be taken to define
abbreviations clearly and to use correct genetic and systematic
<a href="guidelines.action#nomenclature">nomenclature</a>.</p>

<p>We strongly encourage authors to seek input from their
  co-authors and colleagues with different expertise when preparing
  their manuscript for submission to ensure that the style of
  writing, clarity of meaning, and spelling, punctuation, and
  grammar are at a very high level. A variety of style and writing
  guides are available, including <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/141/"><em>The Elements of Style</em></a> (New York:
  bartleby.com, 1999) and <a href="http://www.icmje.org/manuscript_1prepare.html">"Preparing a Manuscript for Submission
    to
    a Biomedical Journal"</a>
  (ICMJE). Editors and/or reviewers may also make suggestions for
  how to achieve optimal quality and clarity of presentation, as
  well as potential cuts or additions that could strengthen the
  manuscript.</p>

<p>Although we encourage submissions from around the globe, we
  require that manuscripts be submitted in English. As a step
  towards overcoming language barriers, we encourage authors fluent
  in other languages to provide copies of their full articles or
  abstracts in other languages. Non-English language versions
  should be submitted as supporting information and listed,
  together with other supporting information files, at the end of
  the article text.</p>


<a name="organization"></a>
<h3>Organization of the Manuscript</h3>

<p>Most Research Articles published in <em>${journal_name}</em> are organized into the following sections: <a
  href="#title">Title</a>, <a href="#authors">Authors</a>, <a href="#affiliations">Affiliations</a>, <a
  href="#abstract">Abstract</a>, <a href="#authorsummary">Author Summary</a>, <a href="#introduction">Introduction</a>,
  <a href="#results">Results</a>, <a href="#discussion">Discussion</a>, <a href="#materials_methods">Materials and
    Methods</a>, <a href="#acknowledgments">Acknowledgments</a>, <a href="#references">References</a>, <a
    href="#figurelegends">Figure Legends</a>, and <a href="#tables">Tables</a>. Uniformity in format facilitates the
  experience of readers and users of the journal. To provide flexibility, however, authors are also able to include the
  Materials and Methods section before the Results section or before the Discussion section. Please also note that the
  Results and Discussion can be combined into one Results/Discussion section. Although we have no firm length
  restrictions for the entire manuscript, we urge authors to present and discuss their findings concisely.</p>


<a name="title"></a>
<h4>Title (150 characters or less)</h4>

<p>The title should be specific to the project, yet concise. It should be comprehensible to readers outside your field.
  Avoid specialist abbreviations, if possible. Titles should be presented in title case, meaning that all words except
  for prepositions, articles, and conjunctions should be capitalized. Please also provide a brief Short Title (or &quot;running
  head&quot;) of no more than 50 characters.</p>

<p>Example title: <br/>
  Detection of Specific Sequences among DNA Fragments Separated by Gel Electrophoresis</p>


<a name="authors"></a><a name="affiliations"></a>
<h4>Authors and Affiliations</h4>

${authors_and_affiliations}

<a name="abstract"></a>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>The abstract of the paper should be succinct; it must not exceed 300 words. Authors should mention the techniques
  used without going into methodological detail and should summarize the most important results. While the abstract is
  conceptually divided into three sections (Background, Principal Findings, and Significance), please do not apply these
  distinct headings to the abstract within the article file. We would however encourage you to include Background,
  Principal Findings, and Significance headings within the abstract field of the submission system. Please do not
  include any citations and avoid specialist abbreviations.</p>

<a name="authorsummary"></a>
<h4>Author Summary</h4>
<p>We ask that all authors of research articles include a 150&ndash;200 word non-technical summary of the work as part
  of the manuscript to immediately follow the abstract. This text is subject to editorial change, should be written in
  the first-person voice, and should be distinct from the scientific abstract. Aim to highlight where your work fits
  within a broader context; present the significance or possible implications of your work simply and objectively; and
  avoid the use of acronyms and complex terminology wherever possible. The goal is to make your findings accessible to a
  wide audience that includes both scientists and non-scientists. Authors may benefit from consulting with a science
  writer or press officer to ensure they effectively communicate their findings to a general audience. Examples are
  available at:<p>
<p><a href="http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.0030124#abstract1">Complex Seizure
  Disorder Caused by <em>Brunol4</em> Deficiency in Mice</a></p>

  Myostatin Gene Increases Muscle Mass and Enhances Racing Performance in Heterozygote Dogs</a></p>

<a name="introduction"></a>
<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>The introduction should put the focus of the manuscript into a broader context. As you compose the introduction,
  think of readers who are not experts in this field. Include a brief review of the key literature. If there are
  relevant controversies or disagreements in the field, they should be mentioned so that a non-expert reader can delve
  into these issues further. The introduction should conclude with a brief statement of the overall aim of the
  experiments and a comment about whether that aim was achieved.</p>

<a name="results"></a>
<h4>Results</h4>
<p>The results section should provide details of all of the experiments that are required to support the conclusions of
  the paper. There is no specific word limit for this section, but details of experiments that are peripheral to the
  main thrust of the article and that detract from the focus of the article should not be included. The section may be
  divided into subsections, each with a concise subheading. Large datasets, including raw data, should be submitted as
  supporting files; these are published online alongside the accepted article. The results section should be written in
  the past tense.</p>

<a name="discussion"></a>
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>The discussion should spell out the major conclusions of the work along with some explanation or speculation on the
  significance of these conclusions. How do the conclusions affect the existing assumptions and models in the field? How
  can future research build on these observations? What are the key experiments that must be done? The discussion should
  be concise and tightly argued. The results and discussion may be combined into one section, if desired.</p>

<a name="materials_methods"></a>
<h4>Materials and Methods (also called Methods or Models)</h4>
<p>This section should provide enough detail for reproduction of the findings. Protocols for new methods should be
  included, but well-established protocols may simply be referenced. While we do encourage authors to submit all
  appendices, detailed protocols, or details of the algorithms for newer or less well-established methods, please do so
  as Supporting Information files. These are not included in the typeset manuscript, but are downloadable and fully
  searchable from the HTML version of the article. </p>

<h2>8. Materials Required for Manuscript Submission</h2>

<h3>Cover Letter</h3> 
<p>It is important that you include a cover letter with your manuscript. Please explain why this manuscript is suitable for publication in <em>${journal_name}</em>; why will your paper inspire the other members of your field, and how will it drive research forward? You are free to recommend a suitable Associate Editor to handle your submission; however, the editors reserve the right to contact an alternative&mdash;either from the board or a guest editor&mdash;if it is considered more appropriate. Please note that the cover letter will be available to the editors and to external peer reviewers as necessary, so be careful not to reveal anything of a confidential nature.</p>

<a name="authorstatus"></a>
<h3>Author Status</h3>
<p>It is the responsibility of the corresponding author to ensure that all authors are aware of and approve the submission of the manuscript, its content, authorship, and order of authorship. Confirmation of this action is required at submission of all manuscripts. </p>
<p>The involvement of any professional medical writer in publication must be declared. We encourage authors to consult the <a href="http://www.emwa.org/Mum/EMWAguidelines.pdf" title="View Guidelines">European Medical Writers\' Association Guidelines</a> on the role of medical writers. For all PLOS journals, the corresponding author must submit the manuscript, related files, and all required data and information. From the point of submission through to publication, all communication related to that manuscript will be directed to and received from the corresponding author only.</p>
<p><em>${journal_name}</em> bases its criteria for authorship on those outlined in the <a href="http://www.icmje.org/ethical_1author.html">Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals</a>, which are summarized below. The contributions of all authors must be described. Contributions that fall short of authorship should be mentioned in the acknowledgments.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Authorship credit should be based on
<ol>
<li> substantial contribution to conception and design, or acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data;</li>
<li> drafting the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content; and</li>
<li> final approval of the version to be published</li>
</ol>
Authors should meet conditions 1, 2, and 3.</p>
<p>When a large, multi-center group has conducted the work, the group should identify the individuals who accept direct responsibility for the manuscript (3). These individuals should fully meet the criteria for authorship defined above and editors will ask these individuals to complete journal-specific author and competing interests disclosure forms. When submitting a group author manuscript, the corresponding author should clearly indicate the preferred citation and should clearly identify all individual authors as well as the group name.</p>
<p>Acquisition of funding, collection of data, or general supervision of the research group, alone, does not justify authorship. All persons designated as authors should qualify for authorship, and all those who qualify should be listed. Each author should have participated sufficiently in the work to take public responsibility for appropriate portions of the content."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>PLOS journals follow the <a href="http://publicationethics.org/">COPE guidelines</a> covering changes in authorship. Please note that if any changes to the list of authors of a manuscript are necessary after the initial submission of a manuscript to a PLOS journal but before its publication, the corresponding author may be asked to provide written confirmation that all authors consent to the change(s). The journal also reserves the right to request written confirmation from all authors (including those added, removed, or moved in the author order). Such written consent may be required before the revised submission is sent to the editors. </p>
<a name="financialdisclosure"></a>
<h3>Financial Disclosure</h3>
<p>This section should describe sources of funding that have supported the work. Please include relevant grant numbers and the URL of any funder\'s Web site. Please also include this sentence: "The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript." If this statement is not correct, you must describe the role of any sponsors or funders, and amend the aforementioned sentence as needed.</p>


<a name="competing"></a>
<h3>Competing Interests</h3>
<p>The submitting author is asked at submission to declare, on behalf of all authors, whether there are any financial, personal, or professional interests that could be construed to have influenced the paper. The information entered here will appear in the published version, so please do not include the same in the manuscript file.</p>
<p>Reviewers are also asked to declare any interests that might interfere with their objective assessment of a manuscript. Any relevant competing interests of authors must be available to editors and reviewers during the review process and will be stated in published articles. Read more about PLOS\'s <a href="competing">Competing Interests Policy</a>.</p>


<a name="electronicformats"></a> 
<h3>Electronic Formats </h3>
<p>Our submission system supports a limited range of formats for text and graphics. The following file formats/types and manuscript information are required before submission. If you are concerned about the suitability of your files, please contact us at ${email}.</p>
<a name="textfiles"></a>
<h4>Manuscript and Table Files</h4>

<p>Articles can be submitted for review in DOC, DOCX, RTF, or PDF. Any articles that have been prepared in LaTeX will be accepted for review, but only in PDF format. After acceptance, only text files (RTF or DOC) of the revised manuscript and tables can be accepted for use in the production process. </p>

<h4>Math Equations and DOCX</h4>

<p>If your manuscript is or will be in DOCX and contains equations, you must follow the instructions below to make sure that your equations are editable when the file enters production.</p>
<p>If you have not yet composed your article, you can ensure that the equations in your DOCX file remain editable in DOC by enabling &ldquo;Compatibility Mode&rdquo; before you begin. To do this, open a new document and save as Word 97-2003 (*.doc). Several features of Word 2007/10 will now be inactive, including the built-in equation editing tool. You can insert equations in one of the two ways listed below.</p>
<p>If you have already composed your article as DOCX and used its built-in equation editing tool, your equations will become images when the file is saved down to DOC. To resolve this problem, re-key your equations in one of the two following ways.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Use MathType to create the equation. MathType is the recommended method for creating equations.</li>
<li>Go to Insert &gt; Object &gt; Microsoft Equation 3.0 and create the equation. </li>
</ol>

<p>If, when saving your final document, you see a message saying &ldquo;Equations will be converted to images,&rdquo; your equations are no longer editable and PLOS will not be able to accept your file.</p>


<a name="latex"></a>
<h4>LaTeX</h4>

<p>Articles prepared in LaTeX may be submitted in PDF format for use during the review process. After acceptance, however, .tex files and formatting information will be required as a zipped file. Please consult our <a href="latexGuidelines">LaTeX Guidelines</a> for a list of what will be required.</p>

<h4>Tables</h4>
<p>Tables must conform to our <a href="figureGuidelines">Guidelines for Figure and Table Preparation</a> and placed at the end of the article DOC or RTF file. Accepted LaTeX submissions only should have table files—which must also conform to these guidelines—uploaded individually into the online submission system.</p>

 <a name="figurefiles"></a>
<h4>Figure Files</h4>
<p>For the article to be accepted for publication, the author will need to supply high-resolution versions of the figures in TIF or EPS format only. When preparing your figures, please ensure that the files conform to our <a href="figureGuidelines">Guidelines for Figure and Table Preparation</a>. Please do <strong>not</strong> upload panels for a single figure separately (for example, Figure 1A, Figure 1B-1D, Figure 1E); each figure file should be a single montage of all panels. Queries can be sent to <strong>figures [at] plos.org.</strong></p>

<p>If you are uploading your files in EPS format, please use the &quot;create outlines&quot; option under the type menu in Illustrator so that all text and fonts appear as intended in print. If you need additional help with figure preparation, please contact <strong>figures [at] plos.org</strong>.</p>

<p>PLOS does not accept vector EPS figures generated using LaTeX. We only accept LaTeX generated figures in TIFF format. Export your LaTeX files as PDFs, and then open them in GIMP or Photoshop and save as TIFF. In general, Figures must be generated in a standalone graphics application such as Adobe Illustrator, InkScape, PyMol, MatLab, SAS, etc. Please see our <a href="figureGuidelines" title="Go to Figure Guidelines">Figure Guidelines</a> for more information.</p>

<p>All figures will be published under a <a href="license" title="View license">Creative Commons Attribution License</a>, which allows them to be freely used, distributed, and built upon as long as proper attribution is given.  Please do not submit any figures that have been previously copyrighted unless you have express written permission from the copyright holder to publish under the CCAL license. </p>

<a name="supportinginfo"></a>
<h4>Multimedia Files and Supporting Information</h4>
<p>We encourage authors to submit essential supporting files and multimedia files along with their manuscripts. All supporting material will be subject to peer review, and should be smaller than 10 MB in size because of the difficulties that some users will experience in loading or downloading files of a greater size.</p>

<p>Supporting files should fall into one of the following categories: Dataset, Figure, Table, Text, Protocol, Audio, or Video. All supporting information should be referred to in the manuscript with a leading capital S (e.g., Figure S4 for the fourth supporting information figure). The numbered title and caption for each supporting information file should be included in the main article file, after the titles and captions for the main figures.</p>

<p>Supporting files will not be included in the typeset PDF, but will be referenced in the text and hosted online.</p>

<p>Supporting files may be submitted in a variety of formats, but should be publication-ready, as these files are not copyedited. Carefully consider whether your supporting information needs to be searchable and/or editable, and choose the most suitable format accordingly. See the <a href="figureGuidelines#multimedia">Figure Guidelines</a> for more detail about our requirements for multimedia files and the file formats we accept.</p>

<a name="strikingimages"></a>
<h4>Striking Images</h4>
<p>Authors are encouraged to upload a "striking image" that may be used to represent their paper online in places like the journal homepage or in search results. Striking images should ideally be high resolution, eye-catching, single panel images, and should ideally avoid containing added details such as text, scale bars, and arrows. If no striking image is uploaded, a figure from the paper will be designated as the striking image.</p>

<p>Please keep in mind that PLOS's <a href="http://www.plosgenetics.org/static/figureGuidelines#ccal">Creative Commons Attribution License</a> applies to striking images. As such, do not submit any figures or photos that have been previously copyrighted unless you have express written permission from the copyright holder to publish under the CCAL license. Note that all published materials in PLOS Genetics are freely available online, and any third party is permitted to read, download, copy, distribute, and use these materials in any way, even commercially, with proper attribution. </p>

<h2>9. Editorials, Interviews, Viewpoints, Perspectives, and Reviews
</h2>

<p>In addition to weekly Research Articles, <em>PLOS Genetics</em> also provides a forum for the publication of other
  article types of broad interest to the genetics and genomics community. These articles are <strong>by invitation
    only</strong>; however, you can send feedback and ideas to <strong>plosgenetics [at] plos.org</strong> and we
  encourage readers to <a href="commentGuidelines.action#overview">add notes, comments, and ratings</a> to all articles.
  Publication charges do not apply to the article types outlined in this section.</p>
<h4>Editorials</h4>
<p>Written by the journal's editors, these occasional pieces can cover announcements, highlights of journal content,
  position statements, and journal updates.</p>
<h4>Interviews</h4>
<p>Jane Gitschier brings her unique conversational style to an ongoing <a
  href="http://collections.plos.org/plosgenetics/interviews.php">Collection of Interviews</a> of interesting people in
  the world of science and genetics. Past Interviews have included exchanges with such luminaries as <a
    href="http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.0010045">Nicholas Wade</a>, <a
    href="http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.0020225">Sir John Sulston</a>, <a
    href="http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.0020079">David Botstein</a> and <a
    href="http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.0020082">Shirley Tilghman</a>.</p>
<a name="viewpoints"></a>
<h4>Viewpoints</h4>
<p>These articles serve primarily as a forum for the discussion of controversial, emerging, or topical issues in the
  field; occasionally, the discussion surrounds a challenge to findings in a published Research Article. In some
  Viewpoints, an expert will cover all sides of a controversial topic in about 2,500 words, with a concise list of the
  most relevant references. In others, opinions or statements will be sought from two authors with different points of
  view &ndash; a point–counterpoint format. In the latter case, the usual format is for each author to express his or
  her opinion within 700 words, with one display item, if available, and a concise list of the most relevant references.
  Each piece will then be sent to the other participant(s), who may choose to respond briefly (~300 words) to the
  opposing position. Should the editor recruit a series of points of view (three or more), soliciting counterpoints will
  be at his or her discretion.</p>
<a name="reviews"></a>
<h4>Reviews</h4>
<p>These succinct, synthetic, well-focused, and engaging Reviews should appeal to a broad genetics readership. Aim for
  no more than 3,000 words, two or three display items, and a concise list of the most relevant references. The article
  should include an overview of the existing literature that places the topic within a broader context, but it should
  also focus on the future: where is the field going and what exciting developments are expected? It is particularly
  important to highlight critical new advances, open questions, and standing controversies or paradoxes as these are
  especially valued by a general readership.</p>
<p>Because these articles are by invitation only, the topic and scope will have been agreed with an editor. It is
  advisable to forward on a short summary or draft in advance of the full submission. Reviews are externally peer
  reviewed so decisions on acceptance will be made in light of these comments as well as input from the editors.</p>
<p>Structure the Review as such: Title, Authors, Affiliations, Abstract, Introduction, Main Text (broken into
  subsections as appropriate), Conclusions, Acknowledgments, References, Figure Legends, and Tables. Please refer to the
  information elsewhere in the <a href="guidelines.action#electronicformats">Author Guidelines</a> about the specifics
  of manuscript, figure, and table preparation. E-mail <strong>plosgenetics [at] plos.org</strong> if you are in any
  doubt about how our guidelines for Research Articles differ from those of Reviews. Examples: <a

<h4>Perspectives</h4>
<p>These commentaries, which are by invitation only, frame the content and implications of Research Articles published
  in the journal. They should be short and engaging; aim for no more than 1,000 words, one display item, and a concise
  list of the most relevant references. As guidance, you should take our broad readership through the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The background: what did we know before; why was the study conducted? In particular, place the specific article in
    a broader context for readers who may not be experts in the field – explain why they should pay attention to the
    highlighted article.
  </li>
  <li>The article itself: what did the researchers do and find; strengths and limitations; what are the implications?
  </li>
  <li>The future: what are the next steps; are there unanswered questions?</li>
</ol>
<p>You are welcome to use subheadings to structure the article as you see fit. </p>

<h2>11. Blogs, Wikis, Embargoes, and the Media</h2>
<p>Authors are of course at liberty to present their findings at medical or scientific conferences ahead of publication.
  We recommend, however, that authors not contact the media or respond to such contact unless an article has been
  accepted for publication and an embargo date has been established. Respect for press embargoes will help to ensure
  that your work is reported accurately in the popular media. If a journalist has covered a piece of work ahead of
  publication, this will not affect consideration of the work for publication. See also our <a
    href="http://www.plos.org/journals/embargopolicy.html" title="embargo guidelines for journalists">embargo guidelines
    for journalists</a>.</p>
