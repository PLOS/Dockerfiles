<h2>6. Peer Review of Viewpoints, Special Reports, and Review Articles</h2>
<p>The best possible review of invited <a href="guidelines#viewpoints">Viewpoints</a>, <a href="guidelines#specialreports">Special Reports</a>, or <a href="guidelines#reviews">Review</a> articles will consider the following criteria, addressing their content, impact, originality, presentation, and relevance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the article contain anything factually inaccurate? </li>
<li>Is the article relevant and of interest to a broad genetics readership? 
<ul>
<li>Does it place the subject area in a larger context?</li>
<li>Is it as free as possible from specialist jargon?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Is the article well written and engaging? </li>
<li>Does the article take the discussion of the topic in a novel direction? 
    <ul><li>Does it specifically highlight the importance of new advances in the field?</li>
<li>Does it specifically highlight any remaining open questions?</li>
<li>Does it specifically highlight controversies or paradoxes (where they exist)?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Are the authors' statements focused and well supported?</li>
<li>Have the authors missed anything important on the topic on which they are writing?</li>
<li>If tables and figures have been included, do they help the reader, or are they unnecessary â€“ conversely, if there is no figure, would one be helpful?</li>
<li>In what ways could the article be improved? </li>
</ul>
<p>When reviewing a Viewpoints, Special Report or Review article, please keep in mind that these manuscripts are, almost exclusively, invited submissions, so please factor this in to your review. Please also keep in mind that the authors have been <em>encouraged</em> to express their own forward-looking (and perhaps controversial) opinions that may well differ from your own.  Unless they are factually inaccurate, these opinions alone should not form the basis of a negative review.  If you have any questions about the peer review of Viewpoints, Special Reports, or Review articles, please contact us at <strong>plosgenetics [at] plos.org</strong>.</p>


<a name="confidentiality"></a>
<h2>7. Confidentiality</h2>
<p>The review process is strictly confidential and should be treated as such by reviewers. Because the author may have chosen to exclude some people from this process, no one not directly involved with the manuscript, including colleagues or other experts in the field, should be consulted by the reviewer unless such consultations have first been discussed with the AE.</p>

<a name="timely"></a>
<h2>8. Timely Review</h2>
<p><em>PLOS Genetics</em> believes that an efficient editorial process that results in timely publication provides a valuable service both to authors and to the scientific community at large. We therefore request that reviewers respond promptly, usually within ten days of receipt of a manuscript. If reviewers need more time, we request that they contact us promptly so that we can keep the authors informed as appropriate.</p>

<a name="anonymity"></a>
<h2>9. Anonymity</h2>
<p>Unless reviewers have explicitly requested to be made known by signing their name at the end of their comments to the authors, we do not release their names either to authors or to other reviewers of the manuscript. We discourage any attempt on the part of authors to discover the identity of any reviewer or to contact this person directly. We encourage the reviewers to adopt the same policy. If authors have requested an anonymous review, a similar policy applies to reviewers who may wish to learn the identity of those authors; in these cases, we discourage any attempts by reviewers to discover the authors' identity and will neither confirm nor deny any conjectures.</p>
