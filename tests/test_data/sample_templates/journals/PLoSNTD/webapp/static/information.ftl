<h1><em>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</em> Journal Information</h1>

<h2>About <em>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</em></h2>

<p class="intro"><em>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</em> (eISSN 1935-2735) is the first open-access journal devoted to the world's most <a href="scope">neglected tropical diseases</a> (NTDs), such as elephantiasis, river blindness, leprosy, hookworm, schistosomiasis, and African sleeping sickness. The journal publishes high-quality, peer-reviewed research on all scientific, medical, and public-health aspects of these forgotten diseases affecting the world's forgotten people.</p>

<p><em>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</em> is particularly keen to publish research from authors in countries where the NTDs are endemic. It aims to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Provide a forum for the NTDs community of scientific investigators, health practitioners, control experts, and advocates to publish their findings in an open-access format</li>
  <li>Promote and profile the efforts of scientists, health practitioners, and public-health experts from <a href="http://www.plosmedicine.org/perlserv/?request=slideshow&amp;type=figure&amp;doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020336" title="Geographic Overlap of the Neglected Tropical Diseases" target="_blank">endemic countries</a>, and build science and health capacity in those countries</li>
  <li>Highlight the global public-health importance of the NTDs and advocate for the plight of the poor who suffer from these diseases in endemic countries</li>
</ul>


<p><em>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</em> is published online by PLOS, a nonprofit organization. The journal's start-up phase is supported by a grant from the <a href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org/GlobalHealth" title="Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation: Global Health Program">Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</a>.</p>

<p><em>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</em> is indexed in PubMed, PubMed Central, Scopus, Google Scholar, and the Web of Science.</p>

<h2>Scope</h2>

<p><em>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</em> is devoted to the pathology, epidemiology, treatment, control, and prevention of the NTDs, as well as public policy relevant to this group of diseases. </p>

<p>The NTDs are defined as a group of poverty-promoting chronic infectious diseases, which primarily occur in rural areas and poor urban areas of low-income and middle-income countries. They are poverty-promoting because of their impact on child health and development, pregnancy, and worker productivity, as well as their stigmatizing features.</p>

<p>To see which diseases are included in the journal, please read the <a href="scope" title="Journal Scope">detailed scope</a>.</p>

<h2>Content</h2>

<h3>Original Research Papers</h3>

<p>Research articles consider all aspects of the NTDs, including their pathogenesis, clinical features, pharmacology and treatment, diagnosis, epidemiology, vector biology, and vaccinology and prevention. Demographic, ecological and social determinants, public health, and policy aspects of these diseases (including cost-effectiveness analyses) are also a priority. <em>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</em> is pleased to publish relevant in vitro and animal studies as well as human investigations. The journal is organized to provide additional support for authors from endemic countries, and such authors are particularly encouraged to submit their research to <em>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</em>. Academic editors, supported by expert peer-reviewers, will select for publication those studies that drive their respective fields forward. </p>

<p>Please refer to our <a href="guidelines" title="Guidelines for Authors">Author Guidelines</a> for instructions on preparing research manuscripts.</p>

<h3>The Magazine Section</h3>

<p>The <strong>Editorial</strong> is written by the Editor-in-Chief or a member of the Editorial Board. </p>

<p>The <strong>Viewpoints</strong> section contains opinion pieces grounded in evidence on topics of broad interest to the journal's readership.</p>

<p>The <strong>Debate</strong> section highlights controversial issues in the field of NTDs.</p>

<p>The <strong>Policy Platform</strong> is for authors to discuss policies that could improve the lives of those at risk of, or affected by, the NTDs. </p>

<p>The <strong>Reviews</strong> section is for authors to summarize the best available evidence on a topic relevant to the NTD community.  </p>

<p>In an <strong>Expert Commentary</strong>, authors discuss the clinical, policy, public-health, or research implications of a freely available research article.</p>

<p><strong>From Innovation to Application</strong> is a section in which authors discuss new technologies, including drugs, vaccines, and diagnostics.</p>

<p>The <strong>Photo Quiz</strong> presents a clinical image and brief case discussion followed by questions, learning points, and key references.</p> 

<p>In the <strong>Symposium</strong> section, authors discuss a "real world" problem, from the clinic, laboratory, or community, and how best it can be tackled.</p>

<p><strong>Historical Profiles &amp; Perspectives</strong> look back in history to discuss a notable figure or a control program that worked or failed.</p>

<p><strong>Interviews</strong> highlight the work of a person who has made a notable contribution to controlling NTDs.</p>

<h2>Open Access</h2>

PLOS applies the <a href="license">Creative Commons Attribution License</a> (CCAL) to all works we publish. Under the CCAL, authors retain ownership of the copyright for their article, but authors allow anyone to download, reuse, reprint, modify, distribute, and/or copy articles in PLOS journals, so long as the original authors and source are cited. No permission is required from the authors or the publishers.

<h2>Publication Charges</h2>
<p>To provide open access, PLOS journals use a business model in which our expenses&mdash;including those of peer review, journal production, and online hosting and archiving&mdash;are recovered in part by charging a publication fee to the authors or research sponsors for each article they publish. The <a href="http://www.plos.org/publish/pricing-policy/publication-fees/">fees</a> vary by journal.</p>

<p>PLOS is committed to the widest possible global participation in open access publishing. To determine the appropriate fee, we use a country-based pricing model, which is based on the country that provides 50% or more of the primary funding for the research that is being submitted. Research articles funded by Upper Middle and High Income Countries incur our <a href="http://www.plos.org/publish/pricing-policy/publication-fees/">standard publication fees</a>. Corresponding authors who are affiliated with one of our <a href="http://www.plos.org/support-us/institutional-membership/members-list/">Institutional Members</a> are eligible for a discount on this fee. Such authors will be informed of the discount applicable after submission of their manuscript.</p>

<p>Fees for Low and Lower Middle Income Countries are calculated according to the <a href="http://www.plos.org/about/viewpoints/global-participation-initiative/">PLOS Global Participation Initiative</a> pricing program for manuscripts submitted after 9am Pacific Time on September 4, 2012 (this program is not retroactive). 
<ul>
<li>Group One: Countries from this <a href="http://www.plos.org/group-one-countries/">list</a> will not be charged for publishing
</li>
<li>Group Two: Countries from this <a href="http://www.plos.org/group-two-countries/">list</a> will be charged a flat $500
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Our fee waiver policy, whereby PLOS offers to waive or further reduce the payment required of authors who cannot pay the full amount charged for publication, remains in effect. Editors and reviewers have no access to whether authors are able to pay; decisions to publish are only based on editorial criteria.</p>

<h2>Measures of Impact</h2>
<p>At PLOS, we believe that articles in all journals should be assessed on their own merits rather than on the basis of the journal in which they were published. Â PLOS journals have therefore initiated a program to provide a growing set of measures and indicators of impact at the article level that will include citation metrics, usage statistics, blogosphere coverage, social bookmarks and expert assessment. The long-term vision is to bring the views and activities of entire communities to bear, using the wealth of opportunities offered online, to provide new, meaningful and efficient mechanisms for research assessment. For more information on article-level metrics see the <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2009/07/plos-journals-measuring-impact-where-it-matters/" title="Read PLOS blog">PLOS blog</a>.</p>
