<h1>Information for Authors in Developing Countries</h1>

<p>As part of its mission to widen the distribution of scientific literature, PLOS is particularly concerned with the disparities in access to information between developed and developing countries. PLOS provides immediate, free, and unrestricted access to all the scientific and medical literature that it publishes. In addition, PLOS is also dedicated to establishing a medium for publishing science from the developing world. Thus, a major goal of <em>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</em> is to promote and profile the efforts of researchers, health practitioners, and public-health experts in <a href="http://www.plosmedicine.org/perlserv/?request=slideshow&type=figure&doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020336" target="_top">endemic countries</a> in order to help build science and health capacity in those regions.</p>

<p><em>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</em> offers the following means of support to authors in developing countries:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Global Participation Initiative.</strong> PLOS is committed to the widest possible global participation in open access publishing. To determine the appropriate fee, we use a country-based pricing model, which is based on the country that provides 50% or more of the primary funding for the research that is being submitted. Research articles funded by Upper Middle and High Income Countries incur our <a href="http://www.plos.org/publish/pricing-policy/publication-fees/">standard publication fees</a>. Corresponding authors who are affiliated with one of our <a href="http://www.plos.org/support-us/institutional-membership/members-list/">Institutional Members</a> are eligible for a discount on this fee. Such authors will be informed of the discount applicable after submission of their manuscript.
  <p>Fees for Low and Lower Middle Income Countries are calculated according to the <a href="http://www.plos.org/about/viewpoints/global-participation-initiative/">PLOS Global Participation Initiative</a> pricing program for manuscripts submitted after 9am Pacific Time on September 4, 2012 (this program is not retroactive). 
  <ul>
  <li>Group One: Countries from this <a href="http://www.plos.org/group-one-countries/">list</a> will not be charged for publishing
  </li>
  <li>Group Two: Countries from this <a href="http://www.plos.org/group-two-countries/">list</a> will be charged a flat $500
  </li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  </li>
  
  <li><strong>Fee Waiver.</strong> We offer a complete or partial fee waiver for any authors who do not have funds to cover publication fees. Editors and reviewers have no access to payment information, and hence an author's inability to pay will not influence the decision to publish a paper.</li>

  <li><strong>Editorial Support.</strong> <em>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</em> is organized to provide additional editorial support for authors in developing countries. Papers that are accepted for publication will receive additional support from our editorial staff or professionals from our partner organizations.</li>

  <li><strong>International Editorial Board.</strong> About 40% of our Associate Editors&#8212;who handle peer review of research articles&#8212;are based in developing countries. These experts understand the issues involved in confronting these diseases in their endemic settings, and they will help to ensure that the journal is a voice for researchers in these countries.</li>

  <li><strong>Worldwide Readership.</strong> As an open-access journal, <em>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</em> articles will always be freely available online via the journal Web site as well as through <a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov" title="PubMedCentral.org">PubMed Central</a>. Our <a href="./license">open-access license</a> means that readers are free to download, print, distribute, and translate your work, provided that they give you credit and cite the source. This means that your work will have the broadest possible audience: the entire world. And <a href="http://opcit.eprints.org/oacitation-biblio.html" title="Open Citation Project | The effect of open access and downloads ('hits') on citation impact: a bibliography of studies">recent studies</a> suggest that open-access articles are downloaded and cited more frequently.</li>

  <li><strong>Influence.</strong> Your research has the chance to be highly influential. Select papers about neglected tropical diseases published in PLOS journals have been downloaded many thousands of times, have been mentioned in international news sources, and have had an important impact on health policy. For example, <a href="http://www.plosmedicine.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0030102" title="PLOS Medicine | Incorporating a Rapid-Impact Package for Neglected Tropical Diseases with Programs for HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria">a paper</a> in <em>PLOS Medicine</em> led to a UN mandate to integrate control of the NTDs into the UN's malaria control efforts. </li>
</ul>
