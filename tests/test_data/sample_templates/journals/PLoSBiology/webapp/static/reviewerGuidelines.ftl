<a name="about"></a>
<h2>1.  About <em>${journal_name}</em></h2>

<p><em>PLOS Biology</em> is an open-access* journal published by the <a href="http://www.plos.org">PLOS</a>. The journal features works of exceptional significance, originality, and relevance in all areas of biological science, from molecules to ecosystems, including works at the interface of other disciplines, such as chemistry, medicine, and mathematics. Our audience is the international scientific community as well as educators, policy makers, patient advocacy groups, and interested members of the public around the world.</p>

<p>* Open access means that every paper is freely available for everyone to read, download, copy, distribute and use.</p>

<a name="criteria"></a>
<h2>2.  Criteria for Publication</h2>

<p>To be considered for publication in <em>PLOS Biology</em>, any given manuscript must be exceptional in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Originality
<li>Importance to researchers in its field
<li>Interest to scientists outside the field
<li>Rigorous methodology and substantial evidence for its conclusions
</ul>

<a name="review"></a>
<h2>3.  The Review Process</h2>

<p>All submitted manuscripts judged potentially suitable for the journal are formally peer reviewed.  Manuscripts are evaluated by a professional editor working in conjunction with an academic editor, usually but not always from the editorial board.   Together, the editors make a decision based on the reviewers' comments. There are several types of decision possible:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accept without revision</li>
<li>Minor revision</li>
<li>Major revision</li>
<li>Reject, typically because it does not fit the criteria outlined above of originality, importance to the field, cross-discipline interest, or sound methodology</li>
</ul>
<p>Although reviewers are welcome to make a particular recommendation, they should do so with the understanding that other reviewers may offer other opinions. When such differences of opinion occur, the professional editor and the academic editor weigh all comments and arrive at a balanced decision based on these. To assist in this process, the reviewer should provide the editors with as much information as possible. A review that clearly outlines reasons both for and against publication is therefore of as much or even more value as one that makes a direct recommendation.</p>

<p>If reviewers appear to disagree fundamentally, the editors may choose to share all the reviews with each of the reviewers and by this means elicit additional comment that may help the editors to make a decision. That said, although the reviewers' comments and opinions on the manuscript are very important, decisions are not made according to some sort of majority rule. Instead, the academic and professional editors evaluate the recommendations and comments of the reviewers alongside comments by the authors and material that may not have been made available to those reviewers.</p>
 
<p>When a paper has been revised in response to comments by reviewers or when authors feel their argument has been misconstrued in review, we ask reviewers to offer additional comments on the revised or contested manuscript. We request that reviewers make themselves available to provide such follow-up advice. We are nevertheless aware that reviewers do not wish to be involved in extended discussions over papers, and we keep such consultations to a minimum while still allowing authors a fair hearing.</p>

<a name="selection"></a>
<h2>4.  Reviewer Selection</h2>

<p>The selection of appropriate and responsive reviewers is paramount to the success of the review process. We decide on reviewers for a particular manuscript based on many factors, including expertise, reputation, specific recommendations of authors and academic editors, and the professional editor's own knowledge of a reviewer's performance.</p>

<p>As part of our editorial procedure, we regularly confer with potential reviewers before sending them manuscripts to review. Reviewers should bear in mind that even these initial messages or conversations contain confidential information, which should be regarded as such.</p>


<a name="writing"></a>
<h2>5.  Writing the Review</h2>
<p>The purpose of the review is to provide the academic and professional editors with an expert opinion regarding the quality of the manuscript under consideration. The review should also supply authors with explicit feedback on how to improve their papers so that they will be acceptable for publication in <em>PLOS Biology</em>. Although confidential comments to the editors are respected, any remarks that might help to strengthen the paper should be directed to the authors themselves. The best possible review would answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the main claims of the paper and how significant are they?</li>
<li>Are these claims sufficiently novel? If not, please specify papers that weaken the claims to the originality of this one.</li>
<li>Are the claims properly placed in the context of the previous literature?</li>
<li>Do the data support the claims? If not, what other evidence is required?</li>
<li>Would any other experiments/data/analyses improve the paper? How much better would the paper be if these were performed, and how difficult would they be to do?</li>
<li>Is this paper outstanding in its discipline? If yes, what makes it outstanding? If not, why not?</li>
<li>Who would find this paper of interest? Why?</li>
<li>If the paper is considered unsuitable for publication in its present form, does the study itself show sufficient potential that the authors should be encouraged to resubmit a revised version?</li>
</ul>

<a name="other"></a>
<h2>6.  Other Questions for Consideration</h2>
<p>In the case of manuscripts deemed worthy of consideration, we would appreciate additional advice from the reviewer on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the manuscript clearly enough written so that it is understandable to non-specialists? If not, how could it be improved? (Please concentrate on matters of organization and content and not on grammatical or spelling errors that will be corrected by our copyeditor after acceptance.)
<li>Have the authors provided adequate proof for their claims without overselling them?
<li>Have the authors treated the previous literature fairly?
<li>Does the paper offer enough details of its methodology that its experiments could be reproduced? 
<li><em>PLOS Biology</em> encourages authors to publish detailed protocols as supplementary information online. Do any particular methods used in the manuscript warrant such a protocol?
</ul>

<a name="confidentiality"></a>
<h2>7. Confidentiality</h2>

<p>The review process is strictly confidential and should be treated as such by reviewers. Because the author may have chosen to exclude some people from this process, no one not directly involved with the manuscript, including colleagues or other experts in the field, should be consulted by the reviewer unless such consultations have first been discussed with the professional editor.</p>

<a name="timely"></a>
<h2>8. Timely Review</h2>

<p><em>PLOS Biology</em> believes that an efficient editorial process that results in timely publication provides a valuable service both to authors and to the scientific community at large. We therefore request that reviewers respond promptly, usually within ten (10) days of receipt of a manuscript. If reviewers need more time, we request that they contact us promptly so that we can keep the authors informed and, if necessary, assign alternate reviewers.</p>

<a name="anonymity"></a>
<h2>9.  Anonymity</h2>

<p>Unless reviewers have explicitly requested to be made known, we do not release their names either to authors or to other reviewers of the manuscript. We discourage any attempt on the part of authors to discover the identity of any reviewer or to contact this person directly. We encourage the reviewers to adopt the same policy.</p>

<p>The academic editor is also anonymous to authors and reviewers unless and until a manuscript is accepted for publication. The academic editor's name is then indicated in the published article.</p>

<a name="editing"></a>
<h2>10.  Editing Reviewers' Reports</h2>
<p>The editors and PLOS staff do not edit any comments made by reviewers that are intended to be read by the authors unless the language is deemed inappropriate for professional communication or the comments contain information considered confidential. Such remarks should be reserved for the confidential section of the review form, which is intended to be read by the editors only. In their comments to authors, reviewers are encouraged to be honest but not offensive in their language. On the other hand, authors should not confuse frank and perhaps even robust language with unfair criticism.</p>
