  <h1>Information on submitting your Data to the Dryad Digital Repository</h1>
<h2>Availability of data and materials. </h2>
<p>PLOS is committed to ensuring the availability of data and materials that underpin any articles published in PLOS journals. PLOS's ideal is to make all data relevant to a given article and all readily replaceable materials immediately available without restrictions (while not compromising confidentiality in the context of human-subject research).
We appreciate, however, that this ideal is not yet the norm in all fields. We are therefore collaborating with a number of subject-specific initiatives in order to develop relevant policies. In the meantime, authors must comply with <a href="http://www.plosbiology.org/static/guidelines#accessionnumbers">current best practice in their discipline for the sharing of data through databases</a>: for example, deposition of microarray data in ArrayExpress or GEO; deposition of gene sequences in GenBank, EMBL or DDBJ; and deposition of ecological data in Dryad. We encourage all authors to comply with available field-specific standards for the preparation and recording of data; for more information, see PLOS Editorial and Publishing Policies (section 8, <a href="http://www.plosbiology.org/static/policies#reporting">Reporting Guidelines for Specific Study Designs</a>). Where no field-specific database exists, authors can deposit data in <a href="http://www.datadryad.org/">Dryad</a>.</p>

<h2>Advantages of depositing data in Dryad include</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>The reuse of your data will include citation of the data, and you can monitor the use of your data through Dryad's usage statistics: <a href="http://datadryad.org/depositing#viewStats">http://datadryad.org/depositing#viewStats</a>.</li> 
  <li>All data packages and data files you deposit will receive persistent, resolvable Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) that can be used in a citation as well as listed on your CV. For further information please see FAQ: <a href="http://datadryad.org/depositing#whatDOI">http://datadryad.org/depositing#whatDOI</a></li>
  <li>Your data files will be permanently and safely archived in perpetuity.</li>
  <li>Making your data available online (and linking it back to the publication) provides a new pathway for others to learn about your work through searches.</li>
  <li>If you receive individual requests for data, you can direct them to the items in Dryad.</li>
  <li>Dryad welcomes data files associated with published articles in the biosciences, as well as software scripts and other files important to the article.</li>
  <li>There is no restriction regarding data formats, and all the data files associated with an article can be archived together;</li>  
  <li>By default, data are embargoed until article publication. </li>
  <li>Data in Dryad are freely available, without restriction.</li>
  <li>Authors may provide a ReadMe file for each data package they deposit so that the data can be correctly interpreted.</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Dryad's statement regarding the strengths of their model:</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Dryad can be <bold>accessed programmatically</bold> through a sitemap or OAI-PMH interface.</li>
  <li>Dryad content is <bold>searchable and replicated</bold> through the <a href="http://www.dataone.org/">DataONE</a> network, and it <a href="http://wiki.datadryad.org/Handshaking">handshakes</a> with other repositories to coordinate data submission.</li>  
  </ul>
  
<h2>CITING YOUR DATA</h2> 
<p>Once you deposit your data package, it receives a unique and stable DOI identifier, which is immediately sent back to you and to the journal for inclusion in the article. We request that you put the citation in the reference section of the article (not just inline in the text, although you may do so in addition).</p> 
<p>For detailed information explaining manuscript status descriptions and outlining the editorial process in more general terms, please see our website: <a href="http://www.plosbiology.org/static/guidelines#overview">Overview of PLOS Biology Editorial Process</a>. When preparing an accepted manuscript for publication, please construct the reference to your data package as indicated by Dryad <a href="https://datadryad.org/pages/using#howCite">here</a>.</p>
