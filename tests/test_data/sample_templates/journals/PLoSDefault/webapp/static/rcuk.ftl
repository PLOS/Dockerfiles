<h1><b>Is your research
funded by RCUK?</b></h1>

<h3>The UK's seven Research Councils and their umbrella organization <a href="http://www.plos.org/publish/rcuk/">RCUK (Research Councils UK)</a> have recently introduced a new Open Access policy. If you are funded by any of the following Research Councils, you need to make sure that any article submitted from 1st April 2013 is made freely accessible online to everyone, everywhere with a license that permits copying, distribution and reuse.</h3>

<b>Research Councils</b>
<li>Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC)</li>
<li>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences
Research Council (BBSRC)</li>
<li>Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)</li>
<li>Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC)</li>

<h3>New Policy</h3>
<p>This <a href="http://www.plos.org/publish/rcuk-open-access-mandate/">new policy</a> from RCUK is designed to help make publicly funded research easily available to all who might benefit from it &ndash; a principal held by PLOS since its inception.</p>

<h3>Compliance is Easy</h3>

<p>All PLOS journals are <a href="http://www.plos.org/publish/plos-and-rcuk-compliance/">100% compliant</a> with the RCUK's strongly preferred "Gold Open Access" standard. Choose to publish in one of our leading journals to ensure you comply with the policy.</p>

<p>Publishing with PLOS means that your article is immediately and freely available online, to anyone in the world who wants to read it. The cost of reviewing, editing and publishing is covered by an Article Processing Charge (APC). The good news for RCUK-funded researchers is that a grant has
been made available to cover these costs, so in most cases your institution will pay.</p>

<h3>Why Choose PLOS?</h3>


<ul>
<li><b>The widest possible readership and impact.</b> PLOS articles attract 5.3 million monthly views.</li><br>
<li><b>Articles made easy to find, read and cite.</b> PLOS articles are indexed by Google Scholar, PubMed and Medline and immediately deposited in PubMed Central.</li><br>
<li><b>Rigorous peer review enhances final published articles.</b> All PLOS articles undergo efficient, thorough peer review by leading experts in their fields.</li><br>
<li><b>Articles published to the highest standards.</b> PLOS is trusted by thousands of researchers &ndash; including 46 Nobel Laureates &ndash; to bring their work to the attention of a global audience.</li><br>
<li><b>Individual article impact assessment.</b> Article-Level Metrics are available for all PLOS articles, demonstrating the broad impact of the work of PLOS authors.</li>
