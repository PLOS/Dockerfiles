            <div class="type"><h1>Maternal Health Task Force (MHTF)-PLOS Collection on Maternal Health</h1></div>
           
<p>Since November 2011, the Maternal Health Task Force (MHTF), an initiative based at the Harvard School of Public
    Health, has collaborated with PLOS to create a freely available, open access collection of outstanding research and
    commentary on maternal health: the MHTF&ndash;PLOS Collection on Maternal Health. </p>


  <p>This 3-year partnership reflects a shared overarching goal: to ensure more people have greater access to more
    comprehensive maternal health data, programmatic experiences, and lessons learned, and to be informed about critical
    areas of debate and growing consensus.</p>
    <p>The Collection is produced with support from the Maternal Health Task Force at Harvard School of Public Health (<a href="http://www.maternalhealthtaskforce.org">www.maternalhealthtaskforce.org</a>).  </p>    <hr/>

  <p>The theme of the <strong>Year 1 Collection (2011-12)</strong> was &ldquo;<em>quality of maternal health care</em>.&rdquo;</p><p>
    See the Call for Papers editorial and the 18 original articles included in the Year 1 Collection <a
      href="http://www.ploscollections.org/maternalhealth_year1">here</a>. </p>

  <p>While the coverage and reach of maternal health services have increased dramatically in many countries around the world, the quality of those services (both institutional and at the community level) have not improved at the same pace. In fact, the quality of maternal health care is highly variable and often extremely poor, even in locations where there is a commitment to improving maternal health through increased access to skilled care, for example. The 18 original articles in the Year 1 MHTF-PLOS Collection offer outstanding research and commentary to help understand and improve the quality of care provided to mothers and their children.</p>

  <p>The theme of the current <strong>Year 2 Collection (2012-13)</strong> is &ldquo;<em>maternal health is women's
    health</em>.&rdquo; </p><p>See the Call for Papers editorial and the regularly updated Year 2 Collection <a
      href="http://www.ploscollections.org/maternalhealth_year2">here</a>.</p>

<p>We chose the theme for Year 2 of &ldquo;maternal health is women&apos;s health&rdquo; because it is crucial to consider maternal health in the context of women's health throughout their lifespans. While pregnancy is limited to women of reproductive age, maternal health is influenced by the health of women and girls before pregnancy, and it also influences women's health broadly during and after the reproductive years. Inability to access quality health care and family planning resources, low educational attainment, low socioeconomic status, restrictive gender roles, poor nutrition, and a host of other social and biological factors combine to put girls and women at risk for not being able to attain and sustain the health status they deserve throughout their lives.</p>
