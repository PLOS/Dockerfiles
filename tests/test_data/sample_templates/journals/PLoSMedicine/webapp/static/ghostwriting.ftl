<h1>Wyeth Ghostwriting Archive</h1>

  <p>In July 2009, a US federal court decision resulted in the
  release of approximately 1500 documents detailing how articles
  highlighting specific marketing messages written by unattributed
  writers, but "authored" by academics, are strategically placed in
  the medical literature - a practice known as ghostwriting. To
  release these documents, <em>PLOS Medicine</em>, represented by
  the public interest law firm <a href=
  "http://www.publicjustice.net/">Public Justice</a>, and <a href=
  "http://www.nytimes.com/"><em>The New York Times</em></a>, acted
  as "intervenors" in litigation against menopausal hormone
  manufacturers by women who developed breast cancer while taking
  hormones. <em>PLOS Medicine</em> argued that sealed documents
  identified during the discovery process for the court case, which
  demonstrated the practice of ghostwriting, should be made
  available to the public. As <em>PLOS Medicine</em> Chief Editor
  Ginny Barbour stated in the motion to intervene, ghostwriting
  "gives corporate research a veneer of independence and
  credibility" and may "substantially distort the scientific
  record"... "threaten[ing] the validity and credibility of medical
  knowledge." On July 24, 2009, U.S. District Judge William Wilson,
  Jr., in Little Rock, Arkansas, granted the motion to make
  discovery materials public as of July 31, 2009.</p>

  <p>PLOS created this web page to make the released documents
  publicly available without delay. The documents are now available
  in indexed, searchable form at the <a href=
  "http://dida.library.ucsf.edu/documents.jsp">Drug Industry
  Documents Archive</a> at the University of California, San
  Francisco.</p>
