<h1>Why Publish in <em>PLOS Medicine</em>?</h1>

<p>Choosing where to send a paper is always a difficult decision. Here are ten ways in which you will benefit by
  publishing your paper in <em>PLOS Medicine</em> rather than another top-tier journal.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Wide dissemination</strong>. <em>PLOS Medicine</em>
    is the leading open-access medical journal, providing an
    innovative and influential venue for research and comment on
    the major challenges to human health worldwide. As an open
    access journal, articles in <em>PLOS Medicine</em> will always
    be freely available online, from our Web site and from PubMed
    Central, to anyone with internet access. This means that your
    work will have the broadest possible audience. And
    <a href="http://opcit.eprints.org/oacitation-biblio.html">recent studies</a>
    have begun to suggest that open access articles get
    downloaded and cited more frequently.
  </li>

  <li><strong>Fast and professional peer review</strong>.
    <em>PLOS Medicine</em> is run by a team of experienced
    professional editors. The professional editors work closely
    with academic editors and peer reviewers to provide authors
    with an efficient, fair, and constructive review process.
  </li>

  <li><strong>Time-saving presubmission inquiries</strong>. It is
    essential that authors provide a <a href="guidelines#presubmission">
      presubmission inquiry</a>, consisting of a referenced abstract
    and a cover letter, prior to full submission. This allows us to
    let you know within 48 hours whether the paper is within our
    scope and whether we will consider the full paper.
    <a href="information">Read more about the scope of the journal</a>.
  </li>

  <li><strong>Rapid publication</strong>. Because we are primarily an online journal, once a paper is accepted we do not
    have to wait for space to become available in the print journal before the paper is published. The time between
    acceptance and online publication is normally around 6 weeks.
  </li>

  <li><strong>Your research, put in context</strong>. Each research article is accompanied by an Editors’ Summary
    written to be understandable by all medical professionals, whatever their specialty, and the general public.
  </li>

  <!-- <li><strong>Reader Responses</strong>. Peer review and publication is only the first step in the assessment process. Equally important is the correspondence that a paper generates. Our <a href="http://medicine.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=read-response&issn=1549-1676&past_days=360">Reader Responses</a> facility allows the scientific community to debate the importance of your findings and the response to be archived.
 </li> -->

  <li><strong>Author-friendly editing</strong>. Unlike other leading publications, we will not totally rewrite your
    paper to conform to house style. We will, of course, help authors whose first language is not English. In addition,
    we will not ask you to shorten your paper unnecessarily, although we do require papers to be written concisely.
  </li>

  <li><strong>No need to order reprints</strong>. Our open access license means that anyone can reprint and distribute
    our content, so long as they credit the author and cite the original source. Commercial publishing companies make
    huge profits reprinting your work—now you have an alternative.
  </li>

  <li><strong>Your research has the chance to have a high impact. </strong> There are a number of ways of measuring a
    journal's impact, including the influence it has on health policy, how widely read its papers are, and how
    frequently the papers are cited by other researchers. For a more information on impact factors see this
    <a href="http://www.plos.org/cms/node/366" title="PLOS Blog">blog</a> and for wider discussion of impact see the
    <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0030291">June 2006 Editorial</a>.
  </li>

  <li><strong>Publicity</strong>. We send out weekly press releases on papers published by <em>PLOS Medicine</em> to
    ensure that papers have the greatest chance of being covered accurately by the media.
  </li>

  <li><strong>Comments</strong>. <em>PLOS Medicine</em> provides comments to
    facilitate community evaluation and discourse around published articles. See our
    <a href="commentGuidelines" title="Comment Guidelines">guidelines
      explaining how you can add comments</a> to any <em>PLOS Medicine</em> article.
