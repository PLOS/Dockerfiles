<h2>1. About <em>PLOS Medicine</em></h2>

<p><em>PLOS Medicine</em> is the leading open-access medical
  journal, providing an innovative and influential venue for
  research and comment on the major challenges to human health
  worldwide. We specifically seek to publish papers which have
  relevance across a range of settings and that address the major
  environmental, social, and political determinants of health, as
  well as the biological.</p>

<p><em>PLOS Medicine</em> gives the highest priority to papers on
  the conditions and risk factors that cause the greatest losses in
  years of healthy life worldwide. For a guide to the conditions and risk factors that we
  prioritize, see Tables 1.1 and 1.2 of <a href=
                                               "http://files.dcp2.org/pdf/GBD/GBD.pdf">Global Burden of Disease
    and Risk Factors</a>.</p>

<p>Within these priority areas we make decisions based on whether
  papers are likely to directly and substantially affect clinical
  practice or public health policy, or have implications of broad
  general interest for the direction of future, directly clinically
  relevant research. In addition, we seek to publish papers that
  address important topics in the ethics and reporting of medical
  research.</p>

<a name="presubmission"></a>

<h2>5. Presubmission Inquiries</h2>

<p>It is essential that authors submit a presubmission inquiry before submitting a full paper. Presubmission inquiries
  allow authors to quickly find out whether their paper is likely to be broadly suitable for <em>PLOS Medicine</em>. To
  submit a presubmission inquiry please log on or register at our <a href="http://www.editorialmanager.com/pmedicine"
                                                                     title="Go to the Journal Management System to Submit your Manuscript">online
    submission site</a>. Click the link "Submit New Manuscript" and select "Presubmission Inquiry". You'll need to enter
  a brief abstract and a referenced cover letter explaining why you think the work is appropriate for <em>PLOS
    Medicine</em>. </p>

<p>The title should be a clear description of the paper's content. The design must be present for Randomized Controlled
  Trials, Systematic Reviews or Meta-Analyses and should be included for other study types if useful. </p>

<p> For research article presubmissions only the abstract should be divided into the following three sections:
  Background, Methods and Findings, Conclusions. It should contain all the following elements, except for items in
  square brackets, which are only needed for some study types. For other article types please just submit a short
  summary paragraph.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>This section should describe clearly the rationale for the study being done. It should end with a statement of the
  specific study hypothesis and/or study objectives. </p>

<p>[For a clinical trial provide any trial identification numbers and names (e.g. trial registration number, protocol
  number or acronym).] </p>

<h3>Methods and Findings</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Describe the participants or what was studied (e.g. cell lines, patient group be as specific as possible,
    including numbers studied).
  </li>
  <li> Describe the study design/intervention/main methods used.</li>
  <li> Describe what was primarily being assessed e.g. primary outcome measure and, if appropriate, over what period.
  </li>
  <li> [If appropriate, include how many participants were assessed out of those enrolled, e.g. what was the response
    rate for a survey.]
  </li>
  <li> [If critical to the understanding of the paper, describe how results were analyzed, e.g. which specific
    statistical tests were used.]
  </li>
  <li> For the main outcomes provide a numerical result if appropriate (it nearly always is) and a measure of its
    precision (e.g. 95% confidence interval).
  </li>
  <li> Describe any adverse events/outcomes or side effects.</li>
  <li> Describe the main limitations of the study.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>

<p>Provide a general interpretation of the results with any important recommendations for future research.</p>

<p>We aim to respond to presubmission inquiries within 2 working days. However, if you do not receive a response in 1
  week please contact +44 1223 442814 (UK office) or +1 415 568 4503 (US office) or e-mail <strong>plosmedicine [at]
    plos.org</strong></a>. </p>

<a name="overview"></a>

<h2>6. Overview of Editorial Process</h2>

<p>Our aim is to provide all authors with an efficient, courteous, and constructive editorial process. To achieve its
  required level of quality, <em>PLOS Medicine</em> is highly selective in the manuscripts that it publishes; rejection
  rates are high. To ensure the fairest and most objective decision-making, the editorial process is run as a
  partnership between the <em>PLOS Medicine</em> professional editors and the editorial board, which comprises leaders
  in all fields of medicine.</p>

<p>Submitted manuscripts will be assigned to one of the <em>PLOS Medicine</em> professional editors. If the paper is
  deemed to be within the scope of the journal with regard to content and of a minimum quality standard an academic
  editor with expertise in the relevant area, usually one of our editorial board, is then also assigned to the paper.
  The editor and editorial board member will promptly assess the manuscript and will decide if it is likely to meet the
  requirement of providing a major advance in a particular field and describing a sufficient body of work to support
  that claim; if so, it will be sent out for peer review.</p>

<p>Expert reviewers will be asked to assess the technical and scientific merits of the work. Where relevant, work
  presented in a manuscript will be subject to a rigorous review of the statistical methods used. <em>PLOS Medicine</em>
  encourages open (non-anonymous) peer-review. As a default, we will pass a reviewer's name on to the authors along with
  the comments. If reviewers do not wish to have their name revealed, they can request to stay anonymous and we will
  honor that request.</p>

${reviewer_exclusions}

<p>Once all reviews have been received and considered by the professional and academic editors, a decision letter to the
  author will be drafted.</p>
<ul>
  <li>There are several types of decision possible: accept the manuscript as submitted; accept it with minor revision;
    invite the authors to submit a major revision of the manuscript before a final decision is reached; reject,
    typically because it does not fit the criteria outlined above of originality, importance to the field,
    cross-discipline interest, or sound methodology
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Revised manuscripts will be assessed by a professional editor and the same academic editor. Sometimes, re-review or
  additional statistical review will be required, but in general we aim to make decisions without involving multiple
  rounds of review.</p>

<p>Upon acceptance, the manuscript enters our production system. Articles may be published online before a complete
  issue is assembled. Research articles are generally published within 6-8 weeks of the date of final acceptance but
  Magazine section articles may take longer to be published. Publication may be further expedited when warranted.</p>

<a name="appeals" id="appeals"></a>

<h3>Appeals of Decisions</h3>

<p>There are, in general, two reasons why we consider articles are not appropriate for publication in PLOS Medicine:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The article is not broadly felt to be an appropriate topic for the journal; e.g. not a sufficient advance, or just
    too specialist in nature. We are usually able to identify such papers at the presubmission enquiry stage, although
    occasionally we need to invite the full paper in before making that judgment. We normally aim to give decisions on
    such papers quickly and without external advice so that authors can seek publication elsewhere. However, the lack of
    an adequate level of advance sometimes only becomes clear after we have obtained in-depth reviews. We may suggest
    alternate PLOS journals for these articles.
  </li>
  <li>The topic of the article is potentially of interest but, either through editorial or peer review, substantial
    methodological concerns are identified such that even after revision the article is unlikely to be of the standard
    we are looking for in <em>PLOS Medicine</em> papers.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>If you wish to appeal a decision in the first instance you should contact the editor; who handled the presubmission
  inquiry or full manuscript, explaining in detail your reasons for the appeal.</p>

<p>All appeals will be discussed with at least one other editor if those editors do not agree the appeal will be
  discussed at a full editorial meeting. We may or may not then seek external advice on appeals.</p>

<p>We do not consider second appeals.</p>

<a name="ready"></a>

<h2>7. Are You Ready To Submit Your Manuscript?</h2>

<p>We have provided an <a href="checklist">author checklist</a> to help you prepare your materials for submission
  and to make the online submission process as straightforward as possible. Please take the time to look through the
  list before submitting your article.</p>

<p>If you are submitting a revised manuscript you will have been given substantial guidance by the editors. We have
  provided a <a href="revisedChecklist">checklist for revised manuscripts</a>.</p>

<p>Text files can be submitted for review in the following formats: DOC, RTF or PDF. Any articles that have been
  prepared in LaTeX will be accepted for review, but only in PDF format. After acceptance, only text files (RTF or DOC)
  of the revised manuscript and tables can be accepted for use in the pre-production and copyediting processes.</p>

<p>Graphics files can be submitted in the following formats: EPS or TIFF files. If possible, please label all figures
  using Times Roman or some other serif font. Please read the <a href="figureGuidelines"
                                                                 title="Figure Guidelines">Guidelines for Figure
    Preparation</a> before submitting figures.</p>

<a name="cover"></a>

<h2>8. Cover Letter</h2>

<p>Please include a cover letter explaining why this manuscript is suitable for publication in <em>PLOS Medicine</em>.
  Why will your paper inspire other members of your specialty or those in other disciplines, and how will it drive the
  understanding of disease epidemiology, clinical research, or patient care forward?</p>

<a name="supporting"></a>

<h2>9. Supporting Information and Materials Required at Submission</h2>

<p><em>PLOS Medicine</em> is committed to the highest ethical standards in medical research. Accordingly, we ask authors
  to provide specific information regarding ethical treatment of research participants, patient consent, patient
  privacy, protocols, authorship, and competing interests. We also ask that reports of certain specific types of studies
  adhere to generally accepted standards. Our requirements are based on the <a href="http://www.icmje.org"
                                                                               title="Uniform Requirements">Uniform
    Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals</a>, issued by the International Committee for Medical
  Journal Editors and are enumerated below.</p>
<a name="human" id="human"></a>

<h3>Human and Animal Research</h3>

<p>All research involving humans and animals must have been approved by the authors' institutional review board or
  equivalent committee(s), and that board must be named by the authors in the manuscript. For research involving human
  participants, informed consent must have been obtained (or the reason for lack of consent explained, e.g. the data
  were analyzed anonymously) and all clinical investigation must have been conducted according to the principles
  expressed in the <a href="http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/b3/index.html">"Declaration of Helsinki"</a>.
  It must be stated in the Methods section of the paper whether informed consent was written or oral. If informed
  consent was oral, it must be stated in the paper: (a) why written consent could not be obtained, (b) that the IRB
  approved the use of oral consent, and (c) how oral consent was documented.</p>

<p>Authors should be able to submit, upon request, a statement from the research ethics committee or institutional
  review board indicating approval of the research. We also encourage authors to submit a sample of a patient consent
  form, and may require submission on particular occasions.</p>

<p>For studies involving humans categorized by race/ethnicity, age, disease/disabilities, religion, sex/gender, sexual
  orientation, or other socially constructed groupings, authors should, as much as possible,</p>
<ul>
  <li>make explicit their methods of categorizing human populations;</li>
  <li>define categories in as much detail as the study protocol allows;</li>
  <li>justify their choices of definitions and categories, including for example whether any rules of human
    categorization were required by their funding agency;
  </li>
  <li>explain whether (and if so, how) they controlled for confounding variables such as socioeconomic status,
    nutrition, environmental exposures, etc.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, outmoded terms and potentially stigmatizing labels should be changed to more current, acceptable
  terminology. Examples: &quot;Caucasian&quot; should be changed to &quot;white&quot; or &quot;of [Western] European
  descent&quot; (as appropriate); &quot;cancer victims&quot; should be changed to &quot;patients with cancer&quot;.</p>


<p><em>PLOS Medicine</em> publishes very few animal studies. We
  will consider animal studies of two kinds:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Translational studies that establish a novel explanatory
    mechanism for a significant clinical problem, to an extent that
    will directly inform specific clinical approaches. Such papers
    must include or refer to human data that is sufficiently
    compelling to establish clinical relevance of the animal
    model.
  </li>

  <li>Models relevant to the treatment or prevention of major
    health problems, in which the interventions cannot be tested in
    humans for ethical reasons, but will provide compelling
    justification for specific changes in the design of subsequent
    clinical trials.
  </li>
</ol>


<p>All animal work must have been conducted according to relevant national and international guidelines. In accordance
  with the recommendations of the Weatherall report, <a
      href="http://www.mrc.ac.uk/Utilities/Documentrecord/index.htm?d=MRC003440">"The use of non-human primates in
    research"</a> we specifically require authors to include details of animal welfare and steps taken to ameliorate
  suffering in all work involving non-human primates. The institution that approved the study must be named, and it must
  be stated in the paper that the study was conducted adhering to the institution's guidelines for animal husbandry.</p>

<a name="privacy" id="privacy"></a>

<h3>Patient Privacy and Informed Consent for Publication</h3>


<!-- THIS IS NEW TEXT PER JO 4991, WAITING ON UPDATED CONSENT FORM PDFS BEFORE POSTING -->

<p>Our human participant policy conforms to the <a href="http://www.icmje.org"
                                                   title="ICMJE | Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals: Writing and Editing for Biomedical Publication">Uniform
  Requirements</a> of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Patients have a right to privacy that should not be infringed without informed consent. Identifying information
    should not be published in written descriptions, photographs, and pedigrees unless the information is essential for
    scientific purposes and the patient (or parent or guardian) gives written informed consent for publication. Informed
    consent for this purpose requires that the patient be shown the manuscript to be published.</p>

  <p>Complete anonymity is difficult to achieve, and informed consent for publication should be obtained if there is any
    doubt. If data are changed to protect anonymity, authors should provide assurance that alterations of the data do
    not distort scientific meaning.</p>

  <p>When informed consent has been obtained it should be indicated in the published article."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For papers that include identifying information, or potentially identifying information, authors must download the <a
    href="/static/plos_consent_form.pdf" title="Consent Form for Publication in a PLOS Journal (English)">Consent Form
  for Publication in a PLOS Journal</a> from our site, which the patient, parent or guardian must sign once they have
  read the paper and been informed about the terms of PLOS open-access license. (This license means that the images and
  text we publish online become available for any lawful purpose). Once authors have obtained the signed consent form,
  it should be filed securely in the patient's case notes and the article submitted to PLOS journal should include this
  statement indicating that specific consent to publication was obtained. "The patients in this manuscript have given
  written informed consent (as outlined in PLOS consent form) to publication of their case details."</p>

<h3>Materials Required for the Submission of Specific Study Types</h3>

${reporting_guidelines}


<a name="status" id="status"></a>

<h3>Author Status</h3>

<p>All authors will be contacted via e-mail at submission to ensure that they are aware of and approve the submission of
  the manuscript, its content, authorship, and order of authorship. Articles will not be published unless all authors
  have provided their assent to publication.</p>

<p>The involvement of any professional medical writer in publication must be declared. We encourage authors to consult
  the <a href="http://www.emwa.org/Mum/EMWAguidelines.pdf" title="European Medical Writers">European Medical Writers’
    Association Guidelines</a> on the role of medical writers.</p>

<p><em>PLOS Medicine</em> bases its criteria for authorship on those outlined in the <a href="http://www.icmje.org">Uniform
  Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals</a>,which are summarized below. The contributions of all
  authors must be described. Contributions that fall short of authorship should be mentioned in the acknowledgements.
</p>
<dl>
  <dd>
    <p>"Authorship credit should be based on<br/>
      1) substantial contribution to conception and design, or acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of
      data;<br/>
      2) drafting the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content; and<br/>
      3) final approval of the version to be published.</p>

    <p>Authors should meet conditions 1, 2, and 3.</p>

    <p>When a large, multi-center group has conducted the work, the group should identify the individuals who accept
      direct responsibility for the manuscript (3). These individuals should fully meet the criteria for authorship
      defined above and editors will ask these individuals to complete journal-specific author and competing interests
      disclosure forms. When submitting a group author manuscript, the corresponding author should clearly indicate the
      preferred citation and should clearly identify all individual authors as well as the group name.</p>

    <p>Acquisition of funding, collection of data, or general supervision of the research group, alone, does not justify
      authorship. All persons designated as authors should qualify for authorship, and all those who qualify should be
      listed. Each author should have participated sufficiently in the work to take public responsibility for
      appropriate portions of the content."</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p>PLOS journals follow the <a href=
                                   "http://publicationethics.org/">COPE guidelines</a> covering changes in authorship.
  Please note that if any changes to the list of authors of a manuscript are necessary after the initial submission of a
  manuscript to a PLOS journal but before its publication, the corresponding author must first contact the journal staff
  and provide a clear reason for the change(s). If the change to the authorship list is appropriate and in keeping with
  the guidelines above, the corresponding author will be asked to provide written confirmation that all other authors
  listed on the manuscript at that time consent to the change(s). Any individuals who the corresponding author requests
  to add or remove from the list of authors will be contacted.</p>

<a name="competing" id="competing"></a>

<h3>Competing Interests</h3>

<p>All authors will be contacted by e-mail at submission to declare whether they have any financial, personal or
  professional interests that could be construed to have influenced their paper. Reviewers are also asked to declare any
  interests that might interfere with their objective assessment of a manuscript. Any relevant competing interests of
  authors must be available to editors and reviewers during the review process and will be stated in published articles.

<h3>Prior Publication</h3>

${prior_publication}

<a name="preparation"></a>

<h2>10. Preparation of Research Manuscripts</h2>

<p><em>PLOS Medicine</em> publishes original research articles of outstanding medical importance. We will consider
  manuscripts of any length; we encourage the submission of both substantial full-length bodies of work and shorter
  manuscripts that report novel findings that might be based on a more limited range of experiments.</p>

<p>The writing style should be concise and accessible, avoiding jargon so that the paper is understandable for readers
  outside a specialty or those whose first language is not English. Editors will make suggestions for how to achieve
  this, as well as suggestions for cuts or additions that could be made to the article to strengthen the argument. Our
  aim is to make the editorial process rigorous and consistent, but not intrusive or overbearing. Authors are encouraged
  to use their own voice and to decide how best to present their ideas, results, and conclusions. Although we encourage
  submissions from around the globe, we require that manuscripts be submitted in English. Authors who do not use English
  as a first language may contact us for additional information. As a step towards overcoming language barriers on
  acceptance of the paper, we encourage authors fluent in other languages to provide copies of their full articles or
  abstracts in other languages. We will publish these translations as supporting information and list them, together
  with other supporting information files, at the end of the article text.</p>

<a name="articleFile" id="articleFile"></a>

<h3>Article File</h3>

<p>Articles can be submitted for review in DOC, DOCX, RTF, or PDF. Any articles that have been prepared in LaTeX will be
  accepted for review, but only in PDF format. After acceptance, only text files (RTF or DOC) of the revised manuscript
  and tables can be accepted for use in the production process. </p>

<h4>Math Equations and DOCX</h4>

<p>If your manuscript is or will be in DOCX and contains equations, you must follow the instructions below to make sure
  that your equations are editable when the file enters production.</p>

<p>If you have not yet composed your article, you can ensure that the equations in your DOCX file remain editable in DOC
  by enabling "Compatibility Mode" before you begin. To do this, open a new document and save as Word 97-2003 (*.doc).
  Several features of Word 2007/10 will now be inactive, including the built-in equation editing tool. You can insert
  equations in one of the two ways listed below.</p>

<p>If you have already composed your article as DOCX and used its built-in equation editing tool, your equations will
  become images when the file is saved down to DOC. To resolve this problem, re-key your equations in one of the two
  following ways.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Use MathType to create the equation. MathType is the recommended method for creating equations.</li>
  <li>Go to Insert &gt; Object &gt; Microsoft Equation 3.0 and create the equation.</li>
</ol>

<p>If, when saving your final document, you see a message saying &ldquo;Equations will be converted to images,&rdquo;
  your equations are no longer editable and PLOS will not be able to accept your file.</p>

<h3>Organization of the Manuscript</h3>

<p>Most articles published in <em>PLOS Medicine</em> will be organized into the following sections: title, authors,
  affiliations, abstract, introduction, methods, results, discussion, references, acknowledgments, and figure legends.
  Uniformity in format will help readers and users of the journal. We recognize, however, that this format is not ideal
  for all types of studies. If you have a manuscript that would benefit from a different format, please contact the
  editors to discuss this further. Although we have no firm length restrictions for the entire manuscript or individual
  sections, we urge authors to present and discuss their findings concisely.</p>

<p>Our submission system can support a large range of formats for text and graphics, but if you experience difficulties
  with the site or are concerned about the suitability of your files, please contact the production department,
  production@plos.org.</p>

<h3>Title (150 characters and spaces)</h3>

<p>The title should be specific to the study yet concise, and should allow sensitive and specific electronic retrieval
  of the article. It should be comprehensible to readers outside your field. Avoid specialist abbreviations if possible.
  If the paper is a randomized controlled trial or a meta-analysis, this description should be in the title. Please also
  provide a brief "running head" of approximately 40 characters.</p>

<p>Examples:<br/>
  Climate Change and Increased Spread of Malaria in Sub-Saharan Africa<br/>
  A Cluster-Randomized Controlled Trial of a Nurse-Led Intervention after Stroke</p>

<p>Please also provide a brief "running head" of approximately 40 characters.</p>

</p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>The abstract is divided into the following three sections with these headings: Background, Methods and Findings, and
  Conclusions. It should contain the all following elements, except for items in square brackets, which are only needed
  for some study types. Please use the same format for abstracts submitted as presubmission inquiries.</p>

<h4>Background </h4>

<p>This section should describe clearly the rationale for the study being done. It should end with a statement of the
  specific study hypothesis and/or study objectives.</p>
<h4>Methods and Findings</h4>

<p>Describe the participants or what was studied (eg cell lines, patient group; be as specific as possible, including
  numbers studied). Describe the study design/intervention/main methods used/What was primarily being assessed eg
  primary outcome measure and, if appropriate, over what period. </p>

<p>[If appropriate, include how many participants were assessed out of those enrolled eg what was the response rate for
  a survey.]</p>

<p>[If critical to the understanding of the paper, describe how results were analysed, ie which specific statistical
  tests were used.] </p>

<p>For the main outcomes provide a numerical result if appropriate (it nearly always is) and a measure of its precision
  (e.g. 95% confidence interval). Describe any adverse events or side effects. </p>

<p>Describe the main limitations of the study.</p>
<h4>Conclusions</h4>

<p>Provide a general interpretation of the results with any important recommendations for future research.</p>

<p>[For a clinical trial provide any trial identification numbers and names (e.g. trial registration number, protocol
  number or acronym).]</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>The introduction should discuss the purpose of the study in the broader context. As you compose the introduction,
  think of readers who are not experts in this field. Include a brief review of the key literature. If there are
  relevant controversies or disagreements in the field, they should be mentioned so that a non-expert reader can delve
  into these issues further. The introduction should conclude with a brief statement of the overall aim of the
  experiments and a comment about whether that aim was achieved.</p>

<h3>Methods</h3>

<p>This section should provide enough detail for reproduction of the findings. Protocols for new methods should be
  included, but well-established protocols may simply be referenced. Detailed methodology or supporting information
  relevant to the methodology can be published on our Web site.</p>

<p>This section should also include a section with descriptions of any statistical methods employed. These should
  conform to the criteria outlined by the Uniform Requirements, as follows: "Describe statistical methods with enough
  detail to enable a knowledgeable reader with access to the original data to verify the reported results. When
  possible, quantify findings and present them with appropriate indicators of measurement error or uncertainty (such as
  confidence intervals). Avoid relying solely on statistical hypothesis testing, such as the use of P values, which
  fails to convey important quantitative information. Discuss the eligibility of research participants. Give details
  about randomization. Describe the methods for and success of any blinding of observations. Report complications of
  treatment. Give numbers of observations. Report losses to observation (such as dropouts from a clinical trial).
  References for the design of the study and statistical methods should be to standard works when possible (with pages
  stated) rather than to papers in which the designs or methods were originally reported. Specify any general-use
  computer programs used."</p>

<h3>Results</h3>

<p>The results section should include all relevant positive and negative findings. The section may be divided into
  subsections, each with a concise subheading. Large datasets, including raw data, should be submitted as supporting
  files these are published online alongside the accepted article. The results section should be written in past
  tense.</p>

<p>As outlined in the Uniform requirements, authors that present statistical data in the Results section, should
  "...specify the statistical methods used to analyze them. Restrict tables and figures to those needed to explain the
  argument of the paper and to assess its support. Use graphs as an alternative to tables with many entries do not
  duplicate data in graphs and tables. Avoid nontechnical uses of technical terms in statistics, such as "random" (which
  implies a randomizing device), "normal," "significant," "correlations," and "sample." Define statistical terms,
  abbreviations, and most symbols."</p>

<h3>Discussion</h3>

<p>The discussion should be concise and tightly argued. It should start with a brief summary of the main findings. It
  should include paragraphs on the generalisability, clinical relevance, strengths, and, most importantly, the
  limitations of your study. You may wish to discuss the following points also. How do the conclusions affect the
  existing knowledge in the field? How can future research build on these observations? What are the key experiments
  that must be done?</p>

<h3>Multimedia Files and Supporting Information</h3>

<p>We encourage authors to submit essential supporting files and multimedia files along with their manuscripts. All
  supporting material will be subject to peer review, and should be smaller than 10 MB in size because of the
  difficulties that some users will experience in loading or downloading files of a greater size.</p>

<p>Supporting files should fall into one of the following categories: Dataset, Figure, Table, Text, Protocol, Audio, or
  Video. All supporting information should be referred to in the manuscript with a leading capital S (e.g., Figure S4
  for the fourth supporting information figure). Titles (and, if desired, legends) for all supporting information files
  should be listed in the manuscript under the heading "Supporting Information."</p>

<p>Supporting files may be submitted in a variety of formats, but should be publication-ready, as these files are not
  copyedited. See the <a href="figureGuidelines#multimedia">Figure Guidelines</a> for more detail about our
  requirements for multimedia files and the file formats we accept.

<h2>11. Other Types of Article</h2>

<h3>The <em>PLOS Medicine</em> Magazine</h3>

<p>The Magazine section is for commentary, debate, analysis, guidance, and review of topics in health and health
  research. Articles will mostly be commissioned, but we will consider unsolicited submissions. Authors of unsolicited
  articles should always send a pre-submission inquiry via our <a href="http://www.editorialmanager.com/pmedicine"
                                                                  title="PLOS Online Journal Management System">online
    journal management system</a> so that we can assess the suitability of the topic ahead of formal submission.
  Magazine articles should be aimed at a general medical audience, and all of the key assertions should be supported by
  evidence.</p>

<p>The <em>PLOS Medicine</em> Magazine has the following sections:</p>

<h3>Editorial</h3>

<p>These are written in house by members of the editorial staff.</p>

<h3>Neglected Diseases</h3>

<p>This section focuses on health problems that could be considered neglected and that have a significant global burden.
  Authors should justify in their article, with supporting evidence, why they consider the problem to be neglected,
  outline the scale of the problem worldwide, and discuss possible policies and solutions for reducing the burden of
  disease.
  Examples might include reproductive and maternal health problems, mental illness in low- and middle-income countries,
  road traffic injuries, and health problems related to migration and conflict. Please note that if your article is
  about a neglected tropical disease that is in the scope of <a href="http://www.plosntds.org/static/scope"
                                                                title="PLOS Neglected Diseases"><em>PLOS Neglected
    Tropical Diseases</em></a>, you should submit it to <em>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</em>.
  Articles should be up to 1500 words with a maximum of 20 references and 2-3 display items (tables, figures, photos,
  illustrations, boxes).</p>

<p>For more details about the Neglected Diseases section, see our editorial on this topic, The Neglected Diseases
  Section in <em>PLOS Medicine</em>: <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0050059"
                                        title="Click to Read Article">Moving Beyond Tropical Infections</a></p>

  in Global Public Health: Surgical Conditions in Sub-Saharan Africa</a>.</p>

<h3>The <em>PLOS Medicine</em> Debate</h3>

<p>These articles will discuss important but controversial issues in clinical practice, public health policy, or health
  in general. Debates will be commissioned from two or more authors with differing points of view.</p>

<p>The usual format is that each author will have the opportunity to express their opinion on a topic of clinical or
  public health importance within 750 words, 10 references maximum, and one display item. Each piece will then be sent
  to the other participant who will be allowed 300 words to respond. Authors should aim to produce a constructive
  criticism of their opponent's views.</p>

<p>In some cases, we will commission a series of at least three different viewpoints on a topic. In this case, we do not
  ask authors to write a counterpoint.</p>

<p>For examples of debate articles that use the "point-counterpoint" structure see:

<h3>Health in Action</h3>

<p>The Health in Action section focuses on innovative health improvement projects. These pieces are often written by
  health activists, non-governmental organizations, or researchers in low income settings. We are particularly
  interested in featuring articles by groups or individuals who rarely have a voice in medical journals.</p>

<p>The piece should be up to 1500 words, with up to 20 references and 2-3 display items. We ask authors to first set the
  scene (why was your project needed?), then describe the project itself and discuss any early results of the project
  and the barriers and difficulties you have faced. Finally, we ask authors to end by looking to the future: where is
  the project heading next?</p>

<h3>Perspectives</h3>

<p>Perspective articles are commissioned from an expert and discuss the clinical practice or public health implications
  of a published open access study (usually a study published in <em>PLOS Medicine</em>). We do not publish unsolicited
  Perspectives.</p>

<p>Articles are up to 1200 words in length, with up to 12 references. Specific guidance to authors for writing a
  Perspective is available <a href="guidancePerspective" title="Detailed Guidance Perspective">here</a>.</p>

<p>For examples of Perspectives see:</p>

<h3>Research in Translation (RIT)</h3>

<p>These articles discuss a particular disease, treatment, or public health intervention in the context of translation
  from early to clinical research or clinical evidence to practice. Some of the articles will be written in hindsight
  and review important steps from scientific discoveries to regulatory approval and practical implementation. Others
  will focus on a particular study and outline the research leading up it as well as future directions along the line of
  enquiry.</p>

<p>An RIT article is not a full review, but could for example be a "bench to bedside" account that suggests where the
  story should go next. The article should provide sufficient history and background to frame the topic for the reader
  with a general background in medical science. It should then discuss selected advances with attention to how these are
  expected to improve care or define future research on the topic. The article should conclude with a summary that
  includes next steps in applying these improvements.</p>

<p>RIT articles should not exceed 1500 words and 20 references. The use of display items (tables, figures, boxes) is
  encouraged. We also ask authors to include a box with "The Five Key Papers in the Field." For each key paper, please
  give a sentence on why the paper was such a breakthrough.</p>

<p>For examples of RIT articles see:</p>

<h3>Policy Forum</h3>

<p>This section is for authors to discuss health issues that have policy implications. We are particularly keen to
  feature articles by health policymakers that discuss the challenges and opportunities in improving health care to
  their constituencies. Articles should not exceed 2000 words, and may cite up to 30 references.</p>

<p>If you are discussing a particular health policy proposal, first provide the background (why is a particular policy
  needed?), then outline your proposal and the evidence that supports it, and then describe the challenges that lie
  ahead in its implementation. The use of display items (tables, figures, boxes) is encouraged. Please keep in mind how
  others might learn from your experiences.</p>

<h3>Essays</h3>

<p>Essays are opinion pieces, grounded in evidence, on a topic of broad interest to a general medical audience. They
  should be up to 1200 words long, with up to 12 references and 2 display items (tables, figures, boxes). Please use a
  series of sub-headings to guide readers through the article, and cite the key evidence in support of your assertions.
  In general, <em>PLOS Medicine</em> Essays tend to follow a 3-part narrative structure along the lines of: What is the
  problem? What is the solution? What needs to happen next?</p>

<h3>Learning Forum</h3>

<p>Learning Forum pieces are case-based educational articles, up to 2000 words in length, and they are mostly
  commissioned. The aims of this section are (1) to present a case in which there are clear teaching points and (2) to
  guide medical readers (who can be at any stage of their career and in any country in the world) to an understanding of
  the best clinical approach to the problem. Learning Forum articles will usually include an analysis of the key points
  in history, examination, and relevant investigations, leading to a differential diagnosis and management plan. The
  Learning Forum Section Advisers are Susan Lightman (University College London, UK) and Ronald Ma (Chinese University
  of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong).</p>

<p>Guidance on writing and structuring a Learning Forum article is available <a href="guidanceLearningforum"

<h3>Guidelines and Guidance</h3>

<p>The Guidelines and Guidance section contains advice on conducting and reporting research. Articles may raise
  awareness of emerging methods in biomedical research, announce a new reporting standard or consensus-type statement,
  or provide a "how to" guide about statistics, study design, or other methodological issues. The Guidelines and
  Guidance Section Advisors are Aziz Sheikh (University of Edinburgh, UK) and John Ioannidis (University of Ioannina
  School of Medicine, Ioannina, Greece).</p>

<p>Articles should not exceed 2000 words, and may cite up to 30 references. If you have written a longer paper, please
  prepare a 2000 word summary and then upload the long version as a Supporting Information file.</p>

<h3>Student Blog</h3>

<p>Since August 2008, <a href="http://speakingofmedicine.plos.org/category/students/">student contributions</a> to <em>PLOS
  Medicine</em> have been hosted on the <em>PLOS Medicine</em> community blog, <a
    href="http://speakingofmedicine.plos.org">Speaking of Medicine</a>.</p>

<p>To contribute, students should e-mail pieces between 200-700 words in length to <strong>studentforum [at]
  plos.org</strong>. A <em>PLOS Medicine</em> editor will evaluate each submission, and if a piece is approved for
  posting, a member of the staff will post it on the student’s behalf. Students will be informed in advance of their
  piece being posted. We hope to make decisions and post quickly.</p>

<p>Prior to the blog, <em>PLOS Medicine</em> published essays called Student Forums and these can still be found in the
  archive.</p>

<p><em>PLOS Medicine</em> requires all authors to agree to its <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/"
                                                                  title="View Open Access Information">open access
  license</a>. This license permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction of the article in any medium,
  provided the original work is properly cited.</p>

<h3>Peer Review</h3>

<p>All articles, with the exception of some perspectives will be peer reviewed before a final decision can be made about
  publication.</p>

<p>Please use the following PLOS house style for references: (a) please number them at the end of the relevant sentence
  (e.g. "Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), characterized by chronic or recurrent relapsing gastrointestinal
  inflammation, are broadly grouped by clinical and pathological features into two groups—Crohn’s disease and ulcerative
  colitis (UC) [6–8]."), and (b) In the numbered reference list at the end of the piece, the house style is "First five
  authors et al, year in parentheses, title, journal citation" (e.g. "Fadok VA, Bratton DL, Konowal A, Freed PW,
  Westcott JY, et al. (1998) Macrophages that have ingested apoptotic cells in vitro inhibit proinflammatory cytokine
  production through autocrine/paracrine mechanisms involving TGF-beta, PGE2, and PAF. J Clin Invest 101: 890–898.")</p>

<p>Finally, please include two statements with your article:</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>Funding: Please state whether you received any specific funding to write your piece. If you did, please state
    whether the funder played any role in the article's preparation.
  </li>

  <li>Competing interests: Please state whether you have any competing interests related to the article (see <a

<h2>12. Outline of the Production Process</h2>

<p>Once an article has been accepted for publication, the manuscript files are sent into our production system. The
  article is copyedited by a professional copyeditor who will correspond directly with the author about needed
  revisions. An Editors' Summary of the study is also added. Once the article has been typeset, galley proofs are sent
  as PDFs to the author to check for serious errors of fact: errors in author names or affiliations, errors of
  scientific fact that would cause misunderstandings to readers, and printer's (introduced) errors. Other correction
  requests will not be fulfilled. Corrections to scientific errors may require editorial approval and cause delays. The
  prompt return of both the copyedited article and the proofs by authors will ensure that the article stays on deadline.

<h2>14. Reader Responses and Notes, Comments and Ratings</h2>

<p>On the 13th March 2009, the Reader Response functionality on <em>PLOS Medicine</em> articles was discontinued in
  preparation for our launch on a new publishing platform that features a number of 'Web 2.0' tools to facilitate
  community evaluation and discourse around published articles.</p>

<p>All the Reader Response contributions that were in our archive are now available as comments directly added to the
  relevant article.</p>

<p>To contribute to an existing discussion about an article or to start a new one, see the <a
    href="commentGuidelines" title="Comment Guidelines">guidelines explaining how you can add Notes, Comments and
  Ratings</a> to any <em>PLOS Medicine</em> article.</p>
