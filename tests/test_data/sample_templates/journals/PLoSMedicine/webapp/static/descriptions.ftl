<h1><em>PLOS Medicine</em> Article Type Descriptions</h1>

<a name="learning_forum" id="learning_forum"></a>
<h2>Learning Forum</h2>
<p><strong>Learning Forum</strong> articles are commissioned by our educational advisors. The section provides a forum for learning about an important clinical problem that is relevant to a general medical audience.</p>

<a name="neglected_diseases" id="neglected_diseases"></a>
<h2>Neglected Diseases</h2>
<p><em>PLOS Medicine's</em> <strong>Neglected Diseases</strong> section began with the launch of the journal in October 2004.  Up until February 2008, the section focused on tropical infectious diseases, such as Buruli ulcer, trachoma, and hookworm.  A list of the 21 articles published from October 2004 to February 2008 can be found in the <a href="http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.0050059#s2">Supporting Information section of our February 2008 Editorial</a>. With the launch of <a href="http://www.plosntds.org"><em>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</em></a> in October 2007, the focus of the Neglected Diseases section of <em>PLOS Medicine</em> shifted from tropical diseases to other health problems that could be considered neglected and that have a significant global burden (such as reproductive and maternal health problems, mental illness in low- and middle-income countries, road traffic injuries, and health problems related to migration and conflict.). Read the <a href="http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.0050059">February 2008 Editorial</a> for information about the section.</p>
