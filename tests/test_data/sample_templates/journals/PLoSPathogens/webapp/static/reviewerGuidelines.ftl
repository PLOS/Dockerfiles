<a name="about"></a>
<h2>1. About <em>${journal_name}</em></h2>

<p>Bacteria, fungi, parasites, prions, and viruses cause a variety of diseases that have important medical, agricultural, and economic consequences. Moreover, the study of microbes continues to provide novel insights into such fundamental processes as the molecular basis of cellular and organismal function.</p>
 
<p><em>PLOS Pathogens</em> reflects the full breadth of research in these areas by publishing outstanding original articles that significantly advance the understanding of pathogens and how they interact with their host organisms.</p>
 
<p>Topics include (but are not limited to) adaptive and innate immune defenses as well as pathogen countermeasures, emerging pathogens, evolution, genomics and gene regulation, model host organisms, pathogen-cell biology, pathogenesis, prions, proteomics and signal transduction, rational vaccine design, structural biology, and virulence factors.</p> 

<a name="criteria"></a>
<h2>2. Criteria for Publication</h2>

<p>To be considered for publication in <em>PLOS Pathogens</em>, any given Research Article must satisfy the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Originality</li> 
   <li>High importance and broad interest to the community of researchers studying pathogens and pathogen-host interactions</li> 
   <li>Rigorous methodology </li>
   <li>Substantial evidence for its conclusions</li> 
</ul>
<p>Manuscripts also must be well written to ensure clear and effective presentation of the work and key findings. </p>

<h2>6. Peer Review of Pearls, Review, and Opinion Articles</h2>
<p>The best possible review of a Pearls article, Review, or Opinion would consider a different set of questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the article relevant and of interest to a broad pathogens readership?</li>
<li>Does this article take the discussion or debate on this topic in a novel direction?</li>
<li>Are the authors' statements focused and well supported?</li>
<li>Have the authors missed anything important &mdash; including important research findings – on the topic they’re writing about? Please provide details of anything important that is missing.</li>
<li>Is the article well written and engaging? Are there any specific sections that do not make sense?</li>
<li>If tables and figures have been included, do they help the reader, or are they unnecessary?</li>
<li>In what ways could the article be improved?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any questions about the peer review of PLOS Pearls, Review, or Opinion articles, please contact us at <strong>plospathogens [at] plos.org</strong>.</p>


<a name="confidentiality"></a>
<h2>7. Confidentiality</h2>
<p>The review process is strictly confidential and should be treated as such by reviewers. Because the author may have chosen to exclude some people from this process, no one not directly involved with the manuscript, including colleagues or other experts in the field, should be consulted by the reviewer unless such consultations have first been discussed with the AE. </p>


<a name="timely"></a> 
<h2>8. Timely Review</h2>

<p><em>${journal_name}</em> believes that an efficient editorial process that results in timely publication provides a valuable service both to authors and to the scientific community at large. We therefore request that reviewers respond promptly, usually within 2 weeks of their receipt of a manuscript. If reviewers need more time, or are unable to perform the review, we request they provide prompt notice and suggestions for 2 or 3 alternate qualified reviewers. </p>
