Its principal goal was to create an international network of scientists to address key research questions about seamounts. Two overarching research themes ultimately evolved:</p><p/><p>(1) What factors drive community composition and diversity on seamounts, and how do they differ from other habitat types?</p><p>(2) What are the impacts of human activities on seamount community structure and function?</p><p/>    <p>A number of seamount reviews and research compilations were published in 2010 prior to the formal completion of CenSeam, but a lot of research initiated earlier in the programme was still in progress. This collection brings together the latest seamount papers, enabling a wide variety of scientific results to be linked. The collection begins with an Overview paper describing the CenSeam programme, focusing in particular on what worked and what did not work in setting up and running this ambitious international programme. The research papers in the Collection cover a broad range of subjects, demonstrating the diversity of seamount science being undertaken in recent years. They include descriptions of faunal communities from several of the world’s oceans, spanning both pelagic and benthic habitats, invertebrates and fishes, and evaluations of the functional role of seamounts in the wider deep-sea environment. The collection concludes with a Review article that examines some of the main findings of CenSeam and other recent seamount research, and their implications for setting future science priorities alongside developing the best ways to both manage and conserve seamount environments and resources.</p><p>Collection citation: <italic>PLoS ONE</italic>: Marine Life on Seamounts - The CenSeam Collection (2012)</p><p>PLoS Collections: <ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:href=\"http://www.ploscollections.org/CenSeam\" xlink:type=\"simple\">www.ploscollections.org/CenSeam</ext-link></p><p><italic>Image Credit: National Institute of Water &amp; Atmospheric Research, New Zealand</italic></p>','2012-02-01 00:00:00','2012-07-03 14:11:00'),(427,'info:doi/10.1371/issue.pcol.v03.i01',55,0,'<em>PLOS Computational Biology</em>: Ten Simple Rules','\0','info:doi/10.1371/image.pcol.v03.i01','<italic>PLoS Computational Biology</italic> Ten Simple Rules','<p>Written by <italic>PLoS Computational Biology</italic> Editor-in-Chief <ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:href=\"http://www.ploscompbiol.org/static/eic.action\" xlink:type=\"simple\">Philip E.

Thus, there can be little doubt that population mobility is among the leading policy issues of the 21<sup>st</sup> century.

Because ghostwriting misrepresents authorship credit and accountability, it is considered to be unethical, dishonest, and a threat to the integrity of the medical literature.

Over the last three decades, many developed countries have shifted the care of people with psychotic disorders from inpatient settings to the community. However, we still have a long way to go. Despite optimal treatment (medication, rehabilitation, and disability support), many people with schizophrenia still have persisting disability. Paintings can communicate the pain and suffering associated with serious mental illness better than textbooks.

They began as an initial response to the striking images I had been seeing in news media and in advertising, both of which often appeared in the same publication. I began collecting images that caught my eye, and then began to turn photocopies of those images, along with drawings, into collages. My aim with this series was to create a series of works that one immediately responds to visually. At the time, I wanted to capture the chaos that was being reported through photojournalists\' images, and the relationship these images had with those images advertising luxury that were presented alongside them. The closer I examined this relationship, the more ironic it became. As a citizen of the developed world, I felt saddened by the fact that while we sit in our comfortable homes filled with the latest technologies, we are entertained by the tragedies our news services report to us. In developing this series, the works became about how our personal interior spaces have become invaded by both of these types of images, to the point where one feels unable to escape.</p> <p>This particular piece of the series was made at the height of the SARS epidemic, and features an appropriation of an image taken during the funeral of a very popular performer in Hong Kong, who committed suicide at that time. Simultaneously, Australia was getting involved with the war in Iraq and that period of time seemed very confusing. I became very interested in what was happening with SARS because I had recently been living in Beijing, China, and was quite concerned about my friends who were over there, and felt quite personally affected by the situation.</p><p><italic>Image Credit: Tammy Wong</italic></p>','2012-05-22 21:49:52','2012-05-22 21:49:52'),(701,'info:doi/10.1371/issue.pmed.v03.i06',5,5,'June','','info:doi/10.1371/image.pmed.v03.i06','<italic>PLoS Medicine</italic> Issue Image | Vol. 3(6) June 2006','<title><bold>Different Approaches to Snake Bites.</bold></title><p>The cover image brings together two papers in this month\'s <italic>PLoS Medicine</italic> that highlight the issue of snake bites.

Such advocacy helped motivate donors to increase their malaria commitments.  The second wave focused on making sure that the extra funding was used to purchase highly efficacious artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) rather than monotherapies such as chloroquine, which are largely ineffective in Africa.

The Italian Space Agency contracted Thales Alenia Space Italia to build a spaceflight payload (Mice Drawer System (MDS)) for mice research on the International Space Station (ISS), including wild type and transgenic strains. The first MDS experiment was launched with the STS-128 Discovery on 28 August 2009, and returned 91 days later on the STS-129 Atlantis.  Three of the six mice survived, exhibiting appropriate behavior in flight and appearing in excellent health at landing, and to date became the mammals with the longest exposure to μG other than humans. After the flight, a replica of the experiment, maintaining the MDS at normal gravity (ground controls), was performed in Genova from November 2009 to February 2010. These studies examined changes that occurred in the flight animals in a wide range of physiological systems, such as muscle, bone, organs and glands, blood, brain (and behavior), and neurosensory, and collectively offer an integrative view of the mammal\'s physiological response to μG.

Since the very beginning of <italic>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</italic>, together with colleagues I have written and submitted a series of papers that try to summarize the major NTDs endemic to a particular geographic region and the key published data for those conditions, with an emphasis on their distribution, prevalence, and disease burden.  Many of these papers were written with colleagues from the actual region.  The first papers along a geographic theme began in 2008 with the Latin American and Caribbean region, in addition to closer looks at Brazil, the Caribbean region, and the United States of America. In 2009 we summarized sub-Saharan Africa and the nations of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference; in 2010 nuclear weapons states, the “Post-American” world, and the Canadian Arctic; in 2011 South Asia, Central Asia and NTDs in the Catholic world; in 2012, the Middle East and North Africa, and also Nigeria. Next year we anticipate publishing a summary of Oceania. We hope this collection of papers will be useful for those interested in a particular part. We also hope the collection will inspire people to think about our global diversity of people and their NTDs.”</p><p><italic>Image Credit: Baks, Vectorstock (2011)</italic></p>','2012-10-25 14:36:29','2013-03-18 17:05:45'),(2137,'info:doi/10.1371/issue.pgen.v08.i10',33,9,'October','\0','info:doi/10.1371/image.pgen.v08.i10','<italic>PLoS Genetics</italic> Issue Image | Vol. 8(10) October 2012','<title><bold>Gene conversion in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> tetrads.</bold></title><p>Mendel established that heterozygous alleles typically segregate in a 2:2 ratio during meiosis.

Malaria remains one of the largest Global Health Challenges, with over 40% of the world population at risk for infection, and ~0.7 million deaths per year still occurring, mostly among children and pregnant woman. Drugs are essential tools for treatment, control and eventual elimination and eradication of malaria. Insecticides have been a main stay in prior eradication campaigns but treatment and prevention with drugs has played a critical role in reducing malaria burdens at many endemic sites.  Some diseases (like small pox) have been successfully eradicated through vaccines. Although the first antimalarial vaccine will soon be marketed, control and eradication will require drugs. This is because protective immunity against malaria is partial at best.  It is also temporary and does not develop to latent stages. The parasite has a complex life cycle, and different stages of management and eradication, need different and multiple drugs. Thus it is unlikely that a single \'super\' drug will eliminate the vast reservoirs of infection and disease. </p><p/><p>The burden of malaria has decreased in many endemic sites, but increased in others. Drugs are essential for the treatment of blood stage infection, which is responsible for the symptoms and pathologies of malaria as well as development of transmission stage parasites. Drugs are also required to break the cycle of infection and to target latent stages in multiple parasite species that cause human malaria. Moreover resistance has emerged to every known antimalarial, including artemisinin, which is critical to the current frontline combination therapy against blood stage infection. If drug resistance to artemisinin becomes wide-spread any gains that have been made to control malaria will be erased.</p><p/><p>To successfully overcome these hurdles, we need multiple combination therapies to provide first, second and third line chemotherapeutic options.  Thus ACTs need to be followed by additional combinations against each of the four different stage (blood, transmission, vector and liver) parasites. Private public partnerships such as the Medicine for Malaria Venture have developed successful strategies to progress new drugs against malaria. Key to the success has been bridging basic discovery research in academia and drug development by pharma (including virtual pharma)</p><p/><p>Editor-in-Chief Kasturi Haldar and Dr. Margaret A. Phillips (UT Southwestern) elaborate on this in their <italic>Speaking of Medicine</italic> editorial, titled \"More drugs for malaria: time to expand the antimalarial portfolio\"  through mining screens and identifying novel targets to develop multiple, front line combination therapies. To highlight the existing literature PLOS (Pathogens, NTDs and Medicine) authors have contributed to basic drug discovery research, Drs. Haldar and Phillips combed the archives to find those articles on novel targets, drug screens and best practices.  They further discuss activities of the world malaria community to successfully integrate basic drug discovery research with translation into a pipeline of treatments that needs expansion and support to control and ultimately eradicate malaria. </p><p>View the Collection here: <ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"http://blogs.plos.org/speakingofmedicine/?p=12047\" xlink:type=\"simple\">http://blogs.plos.org/speakingofmedicine/?p=12047</ext-link></p><p><italic>Image Credit: Delves M, Plouffe D, Scheurer C, Meister S, et al.</italic></p>','2013-04-25 12:02:32','2013-04-25 12:02:32'),(2235,'info:doi/10.1371/issue.pgen.v09.i04',121,3,'April','','info:doi/10.1371/image.pgen.v09.i04','<italic>PLoS Genetics</italic> Issue Image | Vol. 9(4) April 2013','<title><bold>Steroid synthesis regulation: SUMO, Ftz-f1, Scavenger Receptors, and lipids meet in the ring gland</bold></title><p>This confocal image shows a wild type <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> ring gland.

The editors argue that income disparities in wealthy countries are a stronger determinant of health than country-level aggregate measures such as GDP or per capita income.  As rich countries with wide income disparities, such as the United States, address the need to rein in health-care costs and at the same time improve health disparities, knowledge gained in resource-limited settings, regardless of the host country\'s overall wealth, gain increasingly global relevance.  The universal availability of such knowledge in the peer-reviewed literature without subscription-fee or copyright barriers is essential to improving health. The editors conclude that, as part of a commitment to global issues in health, Open-Access medical journals should take the lead in prioritizing research on the health problems of lower-income people in high- as well as low-income countries.  They note that \"whether performed in poorer or richer countries, research on diseases that disproportionately affect poor people is increasingly relevant across all countries.\"</p><p><italic>Image Credit: Luigi Rosa, <ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/lrosa/445738188/\" xlink:type=\"simple\">Flickr</ext-link></italic></p>','2013-10-29 14:02:11','2013-11-20 00:15:05'),(2338,'info:doi/10.1371/issue.pcol.v02.i22',53,20,'Sauropod Gigantism: A Cross-Disciplinary Approach','','info:doi/10.1371/image.pcol.v02.i22','Sauropod Gigantism: A Cross-Disciplinary Approach','<p>Sauropod dinosaurs were the largest terrestrial animals to roam the Earth, exceeding all other land-dwelling vertebrates in both mean and maximal body size.

Research papers focus on programs in Kenya, South Africa, Tanzania, Zimbabwe and Lesotho, identifying strengths and challenges in key program areas, including demand creation, the quality of surgical services, operational efficiencies, data collection and cost controls.</p><p>The VMMC program faces challenges at multiple levels, such as maintaining quality of services while rapidly scaling up, generating demand, and resource and capacity constraints. In order to accelerate scale-up and impact, the Collection authors recommendations include increasing program efficiency by identifying and prioritizing those most at risk of acquiring HIV, matching supply with demand, and exploring the role of technology.</p><p><ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:href=\"http://www.ploscollections.org/VMMC2014\" xlink:type=\"simple\">www.ploscollections.org/VMMC2014</ext-link></p><p><italic>Image Credit: (left) Sgt.
