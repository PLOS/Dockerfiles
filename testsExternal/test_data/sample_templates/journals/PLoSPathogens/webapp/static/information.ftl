<h1>About <em>${journal_name}</em></h1>

<p><em>PLOS Pathogens</em> (eISSN 1553-7374, ISSN 1553-7366) is an open-access, peer-reviewed journal published monthly by <a href="http://www.plos.org">PLOS</a>, a nonprofit organization.</p>

<p><em>PLOS Pathogens</em> is run by an international <a href="edboard">Editorial Board</a>, headed by the Editor-in-Chief, Kasturi Haldar (University of Notre Dame,
Notre Dame, IN, USA).</p>

<h2>Scope</h2>

<p>Bacteria, fungi, parasites, prions and viruses cause a plethora of diseases that have important medical, agricultural, and economic consequences. Moreover, the study of microbes continues to provide novel insights into such fundamental processes as the molecular basis of cellular and organismal function.</p>
 
<p><em>PLOS Pathogens</em> reflects the full breadth of research in these areas by publishing outstanding original articles that significantly advance the understanding of pathogens and how they interact with their host organisms. Topics include (but are not limited to) adaptive and innate immune defenses as well as pathogen countermeasures, emerging pathogens, evolution, genomics and gene regulation, model host organisms, pathogen-cell biology, pathogenesis, prions, proteomics and signal transduction, rational vaccine design, structural biology, and virulence factors.</p>

<p>The journal will not consider purely descriptive studies, such as those that solely identify a new genomic sequence of a related pathogen or a series of related pathogens, the isolation of pathogen variants, or a new strain or type based only on sequence analysis or correlative studies of host and pathogen genotypes.</p>

<p>In most cases, functional predictions or inferences based on genome sequence analysis will also require additional experimental validation that directly tests the prediction/inference and yields novel conclusions about mechanistic models or pathogenesis. Instances where inferences about potential functions can be supported by association studies of genotype-phenotype combined with existing functional data, may also be appropriate, pending approval by the editors.</p>

<p>We encourage authors to submit a presubmission inquiry to determine whether a given study might fit these guidelines. Genomics submissions may go through an initial consultation by our Genomics Editors, in order to ensure our criteria are applied evenly across the journal. The committee membership can be accessed <a href="http://www.plospathogens.org/static/edboard">here</a>.</p>

<p>Please refer to our <a href="http://www.plospathogens.org/static/guidelines">Author Guidelines</a> when you are preparing your manuscripts for submission. If you are unsure whether your paper is suitable for <em>PLOS Pathogens</em>, you can send a <a href="http://www.plospathogens.org/static/guidelines#presubs">Presubmission Inquiry</a>. </p>

<h2>Measures of Impact</h2>

<p>At PLOS, we believe that articles in all journals should be assessed on their own merits rather than on the basis of the journal in which they were published. Â PLOS journals have therefore initiated a program to provide a growing set of measures and indicators of impact at the article level that will include citation metrics, usage statistics, blogosphere coverage, social bookmarks and expert assessment. The long-term vision is to bring the views and activities of entire communities to bear, using the wealth of opportunities offered online, to provide new, meaningful and efficient mechanisms for research assessment. For more information on article-level metrics see the <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2009/07/plos-journals-measuring-impact-where-it-matters/" title="Read PLOS blog">PLOS blog</a>.</p>
