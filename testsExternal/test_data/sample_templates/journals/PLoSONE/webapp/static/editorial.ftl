<h2>1. Publication Ethics</h2>
<p><i>PLOS ONE</i> is a member of the Committee on Publication Ethics (<a href="http://publicationethics.org/">COPE</a>). We abide by its <a href="http://publicationethics.org/resources/code-conduct">Code of Conduct</a> and aim to adhere to its <a href="http://publicationethics.org/resources/guidelines">Best Practice Guidelines</a>.</p> 

<p>We vigorously investigate allegations of publication misconduct, both before and after publication, and we reserve the right to contact authors' institutions, funders, or regulatory bodies if needed. If we find conclusive evidence of misconduct, we will take steps to correct the scientific record, which may include issuing a correction or retraction.</p> 

<p>Authors are expected to be aware of, and comply with, best practice in publication ethics, specifically with regard to authorship, dual submission, plagiarism, figure manipulation, competing interests, and compliance with standards of research ethics.</p>

<p>In cases of suspected or alleged misconduct, we will follow COPE standards and practices and may seek advice from the COPE forum if needed.</p>

<p>Any concerns about the above should be addressed to the editorial office at <b>plosone [at] plos.org</b>.</p>

<p>More extensive resources are available from <a href="http://publicationethics.org/">COPE</a> and World Association of Medical Editors <a href="http://www.wame.org/">(WAME)</a>.</p>

<p><h3>Research Funded by the Tobacco Industry</h3> <i>PLOS ONE</i> will not consider papers in which any of the research costs or authors' salaries have been funded, in whole or in part, by a tobacco company. For a <i>PLOS Medicine</i> editorial describing the reasoning behind this policy, click <a href="http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.1000237">here</a>.</p>

<p><h3>Research Funded by Pharmaceutical Companies</h3> We support <a href="http://www.ismpp.org/initiatives/gpp2.html">GPP2</a> <a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/339/bmj.b4330">Good Publication Practice for Communicating Company Sponsored Medical Research</a>.</p>

<a name="competing" id="competing"></a>
<h2>2. Competing Interests</h2>
<p>All individuals involved with a manuscript, including authors, academic editors, reviewers, and commenters must declare all competing interests.</p>

<p>We may decide not to publish a paper if we believe that the competing interests declared by the authors have compromised the objectivity or validity of the research, analyses, or interpretations in the paper. If we find that authors have competing interests that were not declared upon submission, the manuscript may be rejected. If an undeclared competing interest comes to light after publication, we will issue a formal correction or retract the paper, as appropriate.</p>

<p>
PLOS defines a competing interest as anything that interferes with, or could be perceived as interfering with, the complete and objective presentation, peer review, editorial decision-making, or publication of a manuscript. Competing interests can be financial, professional, or personal, and can arise in relation to an organization or an individual.</p>

<p>Examples of <b>financial competing interests</b> include, but are not limited to:
<ul>
<li>Ownership of stocks or shares</li>
<li>Paid employment or consultancy</li>
<li>Board membership</li>
<li>Patent applications (pending or actual), including individual applications or those belonging to the institution to which the authors are affiliated and from which the authors may benefit</li>
<li>Research grants (from any source, restricted or unrestricted)</li>
<li>Travel grants and honoraria for speaking or participation at meetings</li>
<li>Gifts of any kind</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Examples of <b>non-financial competing interests</b> include but are not limited to:
<ul>
<i>Professional:</i>
<li>Acting as an expert witness</li>
<li>Membership in a government or other advisory board</li>
<li>Relationship (paid or unpaid) with organizations and funding bodies including nongovernmental organizations, research institutions, or charities</li>
<li>Membership of lobbying or advocacy organizations</li>
<li>Writing or consulting for an educational company</li>
</ul>
</p>

<ul>
<i>Personal:</i>
<li>Personal relationships (i.e., friend, spouse, family member, current or previous mentor, adversary) with individuals involved in the submission or evaluation of a paper, such as authors, reviewers, editors, or members of the editorial board</li>
<li>Personal convictions (political, religious, ideological, or other) related to a paper's topic that might interfere with an unbiased publication process (at the stage of authorship, peer review, editorial decision-making, or publication)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>For more information on PLOS policies regarding non-financial competing interests, see this <a href="http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.0050199"><i>PLOS Medicine</i> editorial</a>.<p> 
 
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

<a name="authorship" id="authorship"></a>
<h2>3. Authorship Criteria</h2>

<p>To qualify for authorship, one should contribute to <b>all</b> of the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Conception and design of the work, acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data</li> 
<li>Drafting the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content</li> 
<li>Final approval of the version to be published.</li> 
</ol>

<p>
All persons designated as authors should qualify for authorship, and all those who qualify should be listed. Each author must have participated sufficiently in the work to take public responsibility for appropriate portions of the content. Those who contributed to the work but do not qualify for authorship should be listed in the acknowledgements.</p>

</dl>

<p>When a large group or center has conducted the work, the author list should include the individuals whose contributions meet the criteria defined above, as well as the group name.</p>

<p>All authors must approve the final manuscript before submission. <i>PLOS ONE</i> will contact all authors by email at submission to ensure that they are aware of the submission of the manuscript.</p>

<h3>Writing Professionals</h3> 
<p>Authors must declare any involvement by any professional writer involved in writing a manuscript. They should be included in the author list if they meet the authorship criteria above, or in the acknowledgements if they do not. We encourage authors to consult the <a href="http://www.emwa.org/">European Medical Writers Association</a> (EMWA) <a href="http://www.emwa.org/Mum/EMWAguidelines.pdf">guidelines on the role of medical writers (PDF)</a>. Please contact the editorial office at <b>plosone [at] plos.org</b> for further clarification if needed.</p>

<p>Authors who believe their manuscripts would benefit from professional editing are encouraged to use professional language or copyediting services prior to submission. These services can be found on the web using search terms like "scientific editing service" or "manuscript editing service."</p> 

<h3>Changes in Authorship</h3>
<p>If any changes to the list of authors of a manuscript are necessary after the initial submission but before publication, the corresponding author must contact the journal staff at <b>plosone [at] plos.org</b> and provide a clear reason for the change. If the change to the authorship list is appropriate and in keeping with the guidelines given above, the corresponding author will be asked to provide written confirmation that all other authors listed on the manuscript at that time consent. We will individually inform anyone who is added or removed from the author list.</p> 

<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

<a name="sharing" id="sharing"></a>
<h2>4. Sharing Materials and Data</h2>
<p>By submitting to <i>PLOS ONE</i>, authors agree to make freely available any materials and data described in their publication that may be reasonably requested for the purpose of academic, non-commercial research. Authors should make every effort to allow immediate and unrestricted access to all data and replaceable materials that are relevant to an article, except where this would breach confidentiality rules related to human-subject research.</p> 

<p>If restrictions on access to data or materials come to light after publication, <i>PLOS ONE</i> reserves the right to post a correction, contact the authors' institutions and funders, or retract the publication.</p>  

<p><b><i>PLOS ONE</i> will not consider a study if the conclusions depend solely on the analysis of proprietary data</b>. If proprietary data were used, and the authors are unwilling or unable to make these data public, then the paper must include an analysis of public data that validates the conclusions so others can reproduce the analysis and build on the findings. These policies have been developed in accordance with the principles established in <a href="http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?isbn=0309088593">Sharing Publication-Related Data and Materials</a> (National Academies Press, 2003).</p>

<p>Data for which public repositories have been established should be deposited before publication, and the appropriate accession numbers or digital object identifiers (DOIs) published in the "Methods" section of the paper. Please contact <b>plosone [at] plos.org</b> with any questions about appropriate discipline-specific repositories.</p>

<p>If an appropriate repository does not exist, data should be provided in an open access institutional repository, a general data repository such as <a href="http://datadryad.org/">Dryad</a>, or as Supporting Information files with the published paper. If none of these options are practical, data should be made freely available upon request.</p>

<p>For submissions that describe new software, authors should adhere to appropriate open source standards and deposit source code in an acceptable archive. The manuscript should also provide full details of any algorithms used. See the <a href="guidelines#software">Manuscript Guidelines</a> for further information.</p>

<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

<a name="copyright" id="copyright"></a>
<h2>5. Copyright and Licensing</h2>

<h3>Open Access Agreement</h3>
<p>Upon submitting an article, authors are asked to indicate their agreement to abide by an open access Creative Commons license <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">(CC-BY)</a>. Under the terms of this license, authors retain ownership of the copyright of their articles. However, the license permits any user to download, print out, extract, reuse, archive, and distribute the article, so long as appropriate credit is given to the authors and the source of the work. The license ensures that the article will be available as widely as possible and that the article can be included in any scientific archive.</p>

<h3>US Government Authors</h3>
<p>Papers authored by one or more US government employees are licensed under a Creative Commons public domain license <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/">(CC0)</a>, which allows unlimited distribution and reuse of the article for any lawful purpose.</p>

<h3>Images and Figures</h3>
<p>Submitted manuscripts should not contain any images or figures that have already been published. This can cause serious copyright concerns. If authors must include previously published figures or images, please obtain express written permission from the copyright holder to publish under the CC-BY license.</p>

<p>Authors must also take special care when submitting manuscripts that contain potentially identifying images of people. Identifying information should not be included in the manuscript unless the information is crucial and the individual has provided written consent by completing the <a href="plos_consent_form.pdf">Consent Form for Publication in a PLOS Journal (PDF)</a>.</p>

<p>Further information about policies regarding figures can be found in the <a href="figureGuidelines#ccal">Figure Guidelines</a>.</p>

<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

<a name="fees" id="fees"></a>
<h2>6. Publication Fees</h2>
<p>To provide open access, PLOS journals use a business model in which our expenses&mdash;including those of peer review, journal production, and online hosting and archiving&mdash;are recovered in part by charging a publication fee to the authors or research sponsors for each article they publish. The <a href="http://www.plos.org/publish/pricing-policy/publication-fees/">fees</a> vary by journal.</p>

<p>PLOS is committed to the widest possible global participation in open access publishing. To determine the appropriate fee, we use a country-based pricing model, which is based on the country that provides 50% or more of the primary funding for the research that is being submitted. Research articles funded by Upper Middle and High Income Countries incur our <a href="http://www.plos.org/publish/pricing-policy/publication-fees/">standard publication fees</a>. Corresponding authors who are affiliated with one of our <a href="http://www.plos.org/support-us/institutional-membership/members-list/">Institutional Members</a> are eligible for a discount on this fee. Such authors will be informed of the discount applicable after submission of their manuscript.</p>

<p>Fees for Low and Lower Middle Income Countries are calculated according to the <a href="http://www.plos.org/about/viewpoints/global-participation-initiative/">PLOS Global Participation Initiative</a> pricing program for manuscripts submitted after 9am Pacific Time on September 4, 2012 (this program is not retroactive). 
<ul>
<li>Group One: Countries from this <a href="http://www.plos.org/group-one-countries/">list</a> will not be charged for publishing
</li>
<li>Group Two: Countries from this <a href="http://www.plos.org/group-two-countries/">list</a> will be charged a flat $500
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Our fee waiver policy, whereby PLOS offers to waive or further reduce the payment required of authors who cannot pay the full amount charged for publication, remains in effect. Editors and reviewers have no access to whether authors are able to pay; decisions to publish are only based on editorial criteria.</p>

<h2>7. Peer Review Procedures</h2>

<a name="overview" id="overview"></a>
<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>All manuscripts submitted to <i>PLOS ONE</i> are subject to rigorous review. This review consists of the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Initial submissions are reviewed by internal staff to ensure adherence to <i>PLOS ONE</i> policies, including ethical requirements for human and animal experimentation. </li>
<li>Submissions are then assigned to an <a href="edboard">Academic Editor</a> for evaluation based on the <a href="publication"><i>PLOS ONE</i> Publication Criteria</a>.</li>
<li>The Academic Editor decides whether reviews from additional experts are needed to evaluate the manuscript. The majority of <i>PLOS ONE</i> submissions are evaluated by two external reviewers, but it is up to the Academic Editor to determine the number of reviews required.</li>
<li>After evaluation, the Academic Editor chooses between the following decisions:
<ul>
<li>Accept</li>
<li>Minor Revision</li>
<li>Major Revision</li>
<li>Reject</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the decision is Minor Revision or Major Revision, authors have 45 days to resubmit the revised manuscript. Authors may contact <b>plosone [at] plos.org</b> if they require an extension. </li>
<li>Upon resubmission, the Academic Editor may choose to send the manuscript back to external reviewers, or may render a decision based on personal expertise.</li>
</ol>

<a name="disputing" id="disputing"></a>
<h3>Manuscripts Disputing Published Work</h3>

<p>For manuscripts disputing previously published work, it is <i>PLOS ONE</i> policy to invite input from the disputed author during the peer review process. This procedure is aimed at ensuring a thorough, transparent, and productive review process.</p>

<p>If the disputed author chooses to submit a review, it must be returned in a timely fashion and contain a full declaration of all competing interests. The Academic Editor will consider any such reviews in light of the competing interest. </p>

<p>Authors submitting manuscripts disputing previous work should explain the relationship between the manuscripts in their cover letter, and will be required to confirm that they accept the conditions of this review policy before the manuscript is considered further. </p>

<a name="related" id="related"></a>
<h3>Related Manuscripts</h3>

<p>Upon submission, authors must confirm that the manuscript, or any related manuscript, is not currently under consideration or accepted elsewhere. If related work has been submitted to <i>PLOS ONE</i> or elsewhere, authors must include a copy with the submitted article. Reviewers will be asked to comment on the overlap between related submissions.</p>

<p>We strongly discourage the unnecessary division of related work into separate manuscripts, and we will not consider manuscripts that are divided into "parts." Each submission to <i>PLOS ONE</i> must be written as an independent unit and should not rely on any work that has not already been accepted for publication. If related manuscripts are submitted to <i>PLOS ONE</i>, the authors may be advised to combine them into a single manuscript at the editor's discretion.  </p>

<h2>8. Policies for Specific Research Areas</h2>

<a name="human" id="human"></a>
<h3>Human Subject Research</h3>

<p>All research involving human participants must have been approved by the authors' Institutional Review Board (IRB) or by equivalent ethics committee(s), and must have been conducted according to the principles expressed in the <a href="http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/b3/">Declaration of Helsinki</a>. Authors should be able to submit, upon request, a statement from the IRB or ethics committee indicating approval of the research. We reserve the right to reject work that we believe has not been conducted to a high ethical standard, even when formal approval has been obtained.</p>  
 
<p>Subjects must have been properly instructed and have indicated that they consent to participate by signing the appropriate informed consent paperwork. Authors may be asked to submit a blank, sample copy of a subject consent form. If consent was verbal instead of written, or if consent could not be obtained, the authors must explain the reason in the manuscript, and the use of verbal consent or the lack of consent must have been approved by the IRB or ethics committee.</p> 

<p>All efforts should be made to protect patient privacy and anonymity. Identifying information, including photos, should not be included in the manuscript unless the information is crucial and the individual has provided written consent by completing the <a href="plos_consent_form.pdf">Consent Form for Publication in a PLOS Journal (PDF)</a>. More information about patient privacy, anonymity, and informed consent can be found in the <a href="http://www.icmje.org/about.html">International Committee of Medical Journal Editors</a> (ICMJE) <a href="http://www.icmje.org/ethical_5privacy.html">Privacy and Confidentiality guidelines</a>.</p>

<p>See the <a href="guidelines#specific"><i>PLOS ONE</i> Manuscript Guidelines</a> for detailed instructions for submitting manuscripts describing human subject research.</p>

<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

<a name="clinical" id="clinical"></a>
<h3>Clinical Trials</h3>
<p><i>PLOS ONE</i> follows the <a href="http://www.who.int/ictrp/faq/en/index.html#faq1">World Health Organization's (WHO) definition of a clinical trial</a>: 
<blockquote><b>
...any research study that prospectively assigns human participants or groups of humans to one or more health-related interventions to evaluate the effects on health outcomes...Interventions include but are not restricted to drugs, cells and other biological products, surgical procedures, radiologic procedures, devices, behavioural treatments, process-of-care changes, preventive care, etc.
</blockquote></b>

<p>Clinical trials are subject to all <a href="#human">requirements and policies regarding human research</a>.</p>  

<p>In addition, clinical trials must be registered according to the following guidelines, as supported by the <a href="http://www.icmje.org/about.html">International Committee of Medical Journal Editors</a> (ICMJE) <a href="http://www.icmje.org/publishing_10register.html">Obligation to Register Clinical Trials</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trials initiated after July 1, 2005 must be registered in a publicly accessible registry <b>before patient recruitment has begun</b>. We will <b>not</b> consider studies that have been registered retrospectively.</li>
<li>Trials initiated before July 1, 2005 must be registered before submission</li>
</ul>   

<p>We reserve the right to inform authors' institutions or ethics committees if we become aware of unregistered trials. The ICMJE FAQ on clinical trial registration has further details, and WHO provides a list of approved registries.</p>  

<p>We support the public disclosure of all clinical trial results, as mandated, for example, by the <a href="http://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Legislation/federalfooddrugandcosmeticactfdcact/significantamendmentstothefdcact/foodanddrugadministrationamendmentsactof2007/default.htm">FDA Amendments Act of 2007</a>. Prior disclosure of results on a clinical trial registry site will not affect consideration for publication in <i>PLOS ONE</i>.</p> 

<p>Clinical trials should be reported according to <a href="http://www.consort-statement.org/">CONSORT</a> reporting guidelines for randomized controlled trials, the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/trendstatement/">TREND</a> reporting guidelines for non-randomized trials, <a href="http://www.equator-network.org/resource-centre/library-of-health-research-reporting/reporting-guidelines/experimental-studies/">other specialized guidelines</a> as appropriate. Submissions of all clinical trials must also include the study protocol, which will be published with the manuscript if accepted.</p>  

<p>Find detailed instructions for submitting reports on clinical trials in the <a href="guidelines#clinical"><i>PLOS ONE</i> Manuscript Guidelines</a>.</p>

<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

<a name="animal" id="animal"></a>
<h3>Animal Research</h3>
<p>We work in consultation with the <a href="http://www.plosone.org/static/advisory_group">PLOS ONE Animal Research Advisory Group</a> to develop policies. Animal Research Advisory Group members may also be consulted on individual submissions.</p>
<p>All research involving vertebrates or any regulated invertebrates must have been approved by the authors' Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) or by equivalent ethics committee(s), and must have been conducted according to applicable national and international guidelines.  Approval must have been received prior to beginning research. Details of approval and animal welfare considerations must be included upon submission.</p>  

<p>We reserve the right to reject work that the editors believe has not been conducted to a high ethical standard, even if formal approval has been obtained.</p>  

<p>Where unregulated animals are used or ethics approval is not required by a specific committee, authors should make this fact clear in submitted articles and should explain why ethical approval was not required. Relevant regulations that grant exemptions should be cited in full. It is the authors' responsibility to understand and comply with all relevant regulations.</p>  

<p>We ask authors to follow the ARRIVE (Animal Research: Reporting of <i>In Vivo</i> Experiments) guidelines</a> for all submissions describing laboratory-based animal research and to upload a completed <a href="http://www.nc3rs.org.uk/downloaddoc.asp?id=1831&page=1357&skin=0">ARRIVE Guidelines Checklist</a> to be published as supporting information. Please note that inclusion of a completed ARRIVE Checklist will be a formal requirement for publication at a later date.</p> 

<p>Manuscripts describing research involving non-human primates must include details of animal welfare, including information about housing, feeding, and environmental enrichment, and steps taken to minimize suffering, including use of anesthesia and method of sacrifice if appropriate, in accordance with the recommendations of the Weatherall report, <a href="http://www.acmedsci.ac.uk/images/project/nhpdownl.pdf"><i>The use of non-human primates in research</i> (PDF)</a>.</p>

<a name="paleontology" id="paleontology"></a>
<h3>Paleontology and Archaeology Research
</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Sharing of data and materials.</b> Any specimen that is erected as a new species, described, or figured must be deposited in an accessible, permanent repository (i.e., public museum or similar institution). If study conclusions depend on specimens that do not fit these criteria, the article will be rejected under <i>PLOS ONE</i>'s <a href="publication#data%20report">data availability criterion</a>.</li>
<br>
<li><b>Reporting.</b> Methods and specimens must be described in sufficient detail to allow the work to be reproduced. Data sets supporting statistical and phylogenetic analyses should be provided, preferably in a format that allows easy re-use.<br><br>
Specimen numbers and complete repository information, including museum name and geographic location, are requirements for publication. Locality information should be provided in the manuscript as legally allowable or a statement should be included giving details of the availability of such information to qualified researchers.</li>
<br>
<li><b>Ethics.</b> <i>PLOS ONE</i> will not publish research on specimens that were obtained without necessary permission or were illegally exported.</li>
</ul>

<p>Find detailed instructions for submitting reports describing paleontology and archaeology research in the <a href="guidelines#paleontology">Manuscript Guidelines</a>.</p>

<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

<a name="methods" id="methods"></a>
<h3>Methods, Software, Database, and Tools Papers</h3>
<p><i>PLOS ONE</i> will consider submissions that present new methods, software, or databases as the primary focus of the manuscript if they meet the following criteria:</p> 
<ul>
<li><b>Utility.</b> The tool must be of use to the community and must present a proven advantage over existing alternatives, where applicable.  Recapitulation of existing methods, software, or databases is not useful and will not be considered for publication. Combining data and/or functionalities from other sources may be acceptable, but simpler instances (i.e. presenting a subset of an already existing database) may not be considered.  For software, databases, and online tools, the long-term utility should also be discussed, as relevant. This discussion may include maintenance, the potential for future growth, and the stability of the hosting, as applicable.</li>
<br>
<li><b>Validation.</b> Submissions presenting methods, software, databases, or tools must demonstrate that the new tool achieves its intended purpose. If similar options already exist, the submitted manuscript must demonstrate that the new tool is an improvement over existing options in some way. This requirement may be met by including a proof-of-principle experiment or analysis; if this is not possible, a discussion of the possible applications and some preliminary analysis may be sufficient.</li>
<br>
<li><b>Availability.</b> Software should be open source, deposited in an appropriate archive, and conform to the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/docs/osd">Open Source Definition</a>. Databases must be open-access and hosted somewhere publicly accessible, and any software used to generate a database should also be open source. If relevant, databases should be open for appropriate deposition of additional data. Dependency on commercial software such as Mathematica and MATLAB does not preclude a paper from consideration, although complete open source solutions are preferred. Authors should provide a direct link to the deposited software or the database hosting site from within the paper.</li>
</ul>

<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

<a name="dual" id="dual"></a>
<h3>Dual Use Research of Concern</h3>

<p>"Dual use research of concern" is defined by the <a href="http://oba.od.nih.gov/biosecurity/about_nsabb.html">NSABB (National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity)</a> as any "biological research with legitimate scientific purpose that may be misused to pose a biologic threat to public health and/or national security." <i>PLOS ONE</i> is committed to the widespread dissemination of research while being sensitive to the issues of responsible publication standards. We expect that the potential risks of publishing a scientific paper will outweigh the benefits in only the rarest circumstances. On occasion, <i>PLOS ONE</i> reserves the right to consider manuscript submissions within this context. In addition to the usual scientific scrutiny, such submissions may also be referred to an internal PLOS Dual Use Committee for further deliberation. Authors submitting to <i>PLOS ONE</i> are obligated to disclose potential bioethics/dual use concerns to the journal office at the time of initial submission.</p>
