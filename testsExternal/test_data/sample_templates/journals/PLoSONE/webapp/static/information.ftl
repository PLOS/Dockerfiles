<h2>Scope</h2>
<p><em>PLOS ONE</em> features reports of original research from all disciplines within science and medicine. By not excluding papers on the basis of subject area, <em>PLOS ONE</em> facilitates the discovery of the connections between papers whether within or between disciplines. </p>

<h2>Rigorous Peer-Review</h2>
<p>Too often a journal's decision to publish a paper is dominated by what the Editor/s think is interesting and will gain greater readership &#8212; both of which are subjective judgments and lead to decisions which are frustrating and delay the publication of your work. <em>PLOS ONE</em> will rigorously peer-review your submissions and publish all papers that are judged to be technically sound. Judgments about the importance of any particular paper are then made after publication by the readership (who are the most qualified to determine what is of interest to them).</p>

<h2>Open Access</h2>
<p>PLOS applies the <a href="license" title="PLOS ONE | Open Access and Creative Commons Attribution License">Creative Commons Attribution License</a> (CCAL) to all works we publish. Under the CCAL, authors retain ownership of the copyright for their article, but authors allow anyone to download, reuse, reprint, modify, distribute, and/or copy articles in PLOS journals, so long as the original authors and source are cited. No permission is required from the authors or the publishers.</p>

<h2>Publication Charges</h2>

<p>To provide open access, PLOS journals use a business model in which our expenses&mdash;including those of peer review, journal production, and online hosting and archiving&mdash;are recovered in part by charging a publication fee to the authors or research sponsors for each article they publish. The <a href="http://www.plos.org/publish/pricing-policy/publication-fees/">fees</a> vary by journal.</p>

<p>PLOS is committed to the widest possible global participation in open access publishing. To determine the appropriate fee, we use a country-based pricing model, which is based on the country that provides 50% or more of the primary funding for the research that is being submitted. Research articles funded by Upper Middle and High Income Countries incur our <a href="http://www.plos.org/publish/pricing-policy/publication-fees/">standard publication fees</a>. Corresponding authors who are affiliated with one of our <a href="http://www.plos.org/support-us/institutional-membership/members-list/">Institutional Members</a> are eligible for a discount on this fee. Such authors will be informed of the discount applicable after submission of their manuscript.</p>

<p>Fees for Low and Lower Middle Income Countries are calculated according to the <a href="http://www.plos.org/about/viewpoints/global-participation-initiative/">PLOS Global Participation Initiative</a> pricing program for manuscripts submitted after 9am Pacific Time on September 4, 2012 (this program is not retroactive). 
<ul>
<li>Group One: Countries from this <a href="http://www.plos.org/group-one-countries/">list</a> will not be charged for publishing
</li>
<li>Group Two: Countries from this <a href="http://www.plos.org/group-two-countries/">list</a> will be charged a flat $500
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Our fee waiver policy, whereby PLOS offers to waive or further reduce the payment required of authors who cannot pay the full amount charged for publication, remains in effect. Editors and reviewers have no access to whether authors are able to pay; decisions to publish are only based on editorial criteria.</p>

<h2>Measures of Impact</h2>
<p>At PLOS, we believe that articles in all journals should be assessed on their own merits rather than on the basis of the journal in which they were published. Â PLOS journals have therefore initiated a program to provide a growing set of measures and indicators of impact at the article level that will include citation metrics, usage statistics, blogosphere coverage, social bookmarks, community rating and expert assessment. The long-term vision is to bring the views and activities of entire communities to bear, using the wealth of opportunities offered online, to provide new, meaningful and efficient mechanisms for research assessment. For more information on article-level metrics see the <a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2009/07/plos-journals-measuring-impact-where-it-matters/" title="Read PLOS blog">PLOS blog</a>.</p>

<h2>Editorial and Peer-Review Process</h2>

<p>Each submission to <em>PLOS ONE</em> passes through a rigorous quality control and peer-review 
evaluation process before receiving a decision. Beginning in 2008, we are providing the following 
summary data regarding our process. This information will be updated quarterly with the latest 
data:</p>

<p>
<ul>
  <li>The <em>PLOS ONE</em> criteria for publication are as follows (<a 
href="/static/guidelines#criteria" title="criteria for publication">more detailed information
is provided here</a>):
  <ul>
    <li>The study presents the results of primary scientific research. </li>
    <li>Results reported have not been published elsewhere. </li>
    <li>Experiments, statistics, and other analyses are performed to a high technical 
standard and are described in sufficient detail. </li>
    <li>Conclusions are presented in an appropriate fashion and are supported by the 
data. </li>
    <li>The article is presented in an intelligible fashion and is written in standard 
English. </li>
    <li>The research meets all applicable standards for the ethics of experimentation and 
research integrity. </li>
    <li>The article adheres to appropriate reporting guidelines and community standards 
for data availability.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Each submission is subjected to an in-house quality control check, which deals with 
issues such as competing interests; ethical requirements for studies involving human participants or 
animals; financial disclosures; full compliance with data deposition standards, etc. Submissions may 
be returned to authors for queries, and will not be seen by our Editorial Board or Peer Reviewers 
until they pass this quality control check.</li>
  <li>We use an international Editorial Board of over 3,000 academic experts, and a list of 
their areas of expertise is available at: <a 
href="http://www.plosone.org/static/edboard">http://www.plosone.org/static/edboard</a>.
Once each manuscript has passed quality control, it is assigned to a member of the Editorial Board, 
who takes responsibility as the Academic Editor for the submission. The Academic Editor is 
responsible for conducting the peer-review process and for making a decision to accept, invite 
revision of, or reject the article. <a href="/static/guidelines#editorial">Further details of
the editorial process are described here</a>.</li>
  <li>Our <a href="/static/reviewerGuidelines">instructions for Peer Reviewers are to be
found here</a>. 
    Currently, of the articles that are ultimately accepted for publication, <a 
href="#1">95.8%*</a> were sent for review by external experts. 
    Around <a href="#1">4.2%*</a> of articles are peer reviewed by the Academic Editors 
themselves (often in consultation with other members of the Editorial Board) when they are 
sufficiently expert in the field to determine whether the paper meets the <a 
href="/static/reviewerGuidelines#criteria"><em>PLOS ONE</em> criteria</a>.</li>
  <li>On average, ALL accepted articles have been reviewed by <a href="#1">2.9*</a> experts 
(one Academic Editor and <a href="#1">1.9*</a> external Peer Reviewers).</li>
  <li>Authors can recommend specific Academic Editors, but <em>PLOS ONE</em> is not obliged to 
use that suggestion, and the identity of the Academic Editor is not revealed until a decision is 
rendered. The Academic Editor is also publicly identified on all published articles. If Peer 
Reviewers are willing, then they are also identified to the author at the time of decision.</li>
  <li>On average, <em>PLOS ONE</em> publishes <a href="#2">69%**</a> of all submissions.</li>
  <li>Rejected papers are given the opportunity for a formal appeal. Appeal requests should be made in writing, not by telephone, and should be addressed to <b>plosone [at] plos.org</b> with the word "appeal" in the subject line. Authors should provide detailed reasons for the appeal and point-by-point responses to the reviewers' and/or Academic Editor's comments. Decisions on appeals are final without exception. Authors should also be aware that priority is given to new submissions to the journal and so the processing of the appeal may well take longer than the processing of the original submission.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<hr />
<a name="1"></a><p>*Data refer to the 1,837 manuscripts that received a decision in the period 7/1/10 
- 9/30/10.</p>
<a name="2"></a><p>**Data refer to the 2,216 manuscripts submitted in the period 1/1/10 - 3/31/10 and 
their status as of 10/5/10. We quote data from an earlier time period as some submissions spend time 
passing through revisions and re-evaluations before ultimately being accepted or rejected. Therefore, 
if we quoted data for submissions in the most recent quarter, it would not give a complete picture 
for those papers still being evaluated.</p>
