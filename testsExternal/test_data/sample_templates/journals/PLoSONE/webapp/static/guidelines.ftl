<h2>1. Format Requirements</h2>

<p><i>PLOS ONE</i> does <b>not</b> consider presubmission inquiries. All submissions should be prepared with the
  following files:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cover letter</li>
  <li>Manuscript, including tables and figure legends</li>
  <li>Figures (guidelines for preparing figures can be found at the <a href="figureGuidelines">Figure and Table
    Guidelines</a>)
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Prior to submission, authors who believe their manuscripts would benefit from professional editing are encouraged to
  use language-editing and copyediting services. Obtaining this service is the responsibility of the author, and should
  be done before initial submission. These services can be found on the web using search terms like "scientific editing
  service" or "manuscript editing service." Submissions are <b>not</b> copyedited before publication. </p>

<p>Submissions that do not meet the <a href="publication#language"><i>PLOS ONE</i> Publication Criterion for language
  standards</a> may be rejected. </p>


<h3>Cover Letter</h3>
<p>You should supply an approximately one page cover letter that:
<ul>
  <li>Concisely summarizes why your paper is a valuable addition to the scientific literature</li>
  <li>Briefly relates your study to previously published work</li>
  <li>Specifies the type of article you are submitting (for example, research article, systematic review, meta-analysis,
    clinical trial)
  </li>
  <li>Describes any prior interactions with PLOS regarding the submitted manuscript</li>
  <li>Suggests appropriate <i>PLOS ONE</i> Academic Editors to handle your manuscript (view a <a href="edboard">complete
    listing of our academic editors)</a></li>
  <li>Lists any recommended or opposed reviewers</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
  Your cover letter should <b>not</b> include requests to reduce or waive publication fees. Should your manuscript be
  accepted, you will have the opportunity to include your requests at that time. See <a href="editorial#fees"><i>PLOS
  ONE</i> Editorial Policy</a> for more information regarding publication fees.
</p>

<a name="organization" id="organization"></a>
<h3>Manuscript Organization</h3>
<p><i>PLOS ONE</i> considers manuscripts of any length. There are no explicit restrictions for the number of words,
  figures, or the length of the supporting information, although we encourage a concise and accessible writing style. We
  will <b>not</b> consider monographs.</p>

<p>All manuscripts should be double-spaced and include line numbers and page numbers.</p>

<p>Manuscripts should begin with the ordered sections:
<ul>
  <li>Title</li>
  <li>Authors</li>
  <li>Affiliations</li>
  <li>Abstract</li>
  <li>Introduction</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>and end with the sections of:
<ul>
  <li>Acknowledgments</li>
  <li>References</li>
  <li>Figure Legends</li>
  <li>Tables</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>Figures should not be included in the main manuscript file. Each figure must be prepared and submitted as an
  individual file.</b> Find more information about preparing figures <a href="figureGuidelines">here</a>.</p>

<p>The title, authors, and affiliations should all be included on a title page as the first page of the manuscript
  file.</p>

<p>There are no explicit requirements for section organization between these beginning and ending sections. Articles may
  be organized in different ways and with different section titles, according to the authors' preference. In most cases,
  internal sections include:
<ul>
  <li>Materials and Methods</li>
  <li>Results</li>
  <li>Discussion</li>
  <li>Conclusions (optional)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><i>PLOS ONE</i> has no specific requirements for the order of these sections, and in some cases it may be appropriate
  to combine sections. Guidelines for individual sections can be found <a href="guidelines#guidelines">below</a>.</p>

<p>Abbreviations should be kept to a minimum and defined upon first use in the text. Non-standard abbreviations should
  not be used unless they appear at least three times in the text. </p>

<p>Standardized nomenclature should be used as appropriate, including appropriate usage of species names and SI
  units.</p>

<h3>Manuscript File Type Requirements</h3>
<p>Authors may submit their manuscript files in Word (as .doc or .docx), LaTeX (as .pdf), or RTF format. Only RTF and
  .doc files can be used during the production process. Word files must not be protected.</p>

<p><b>LaTeX Submissions.</b> If you would like to submit your manuscript using LaTeX, you must author your article using
  the <a href="plos_template.tex"><i>PLOS ONE</i> LaTeX template</a> and <a href="plos2009.bst">BibTeX style sheet</a>.
  Articles prepared in LaTeX may be submitted in PDF format for use during the review process. After acceptance,
  however, .tex files and formatting information will be required as a zipped file. Please consult our <a
    href="latexGuidelines">LaTeX guidelines</a> for a list of what will be required.</p>

<p><b>Submissions with equations.</b> If your manuscript is or will be in .docx format and contains equations, you must
  follow the instructions below to make sure that your equations are editable when the file enters production.</p>

<p>If you have not yet composed your article, you can ensure that the equations in your .docx file remain editable in
  .doc by enabling "Compatibility Mode" before you begin. To do this, open a new document and save as Word 97-2003
  (*.doc). Several features of Word 2007/10 will now be inactive, including the built-in equation editing tool. You can
  insert equations in one of the two ways listed below.</p>

<p>If you have already composed your article as .docx and used its built-in equation editing tool, your equations will
  become images when the file is saved down to .doc. To resolve this problem, re-key your equations in one of the two
  following ways. </p>

<p>
  1. Use MathType to create the equation (recommended)<br>
  2. Go to Insert > Object > Microsoft Equation 3.0 and create the equation
</p>

<p>If, when saving your final document, you see a message saying "Equations will be converted to images," your equations
  are no longer editable and PLoS will not be able to accept your file.</p>

<h2>2. Guidelines for Standard Sections</h2>

<a name="title" id="title"></a>
<h3>Title</h3>
<p>Manuscripts must be submitted with both a full title and a short title, which will appear at the top of the PDF upon
  publication if accepted. Only the full title should be included in the manuscript file; the short title will be
  entered during the online submission process.</p>

<p>The full title must be 250 characters or fewer. It should be specific, descriptive, concise, and comprehensible to
  readers outside the subject field. Avoid abbreviations if possible. Where appropriate, authors should include the
  species or model system used (for biological papers) or type of study design (for clinical papers).</p>
<p>
  <i>Examples:</i>
<ul>
  <li>Impact of Cigarette Smoke Exposure on Innate Immunity: A <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> Model</li>
  <li>Solar Drinking Water Disinfection (SODIS) to Reduce Childhood Diarrhoea in Rural Bolivia: A Cluster-Randomized,
    Controlled Trial
  </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The short title must be 50 characters or fewer and should state the topic of the paper.</p>

<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

<a name="authors" id="authors"></a>
<h3>Authors and Affiliations</h3>

<p>All author names should be listed in the following order:
<ul>
  <li>First names (or initials, if used),</li>
  <li>Middle names (or initials, if used), and</li>
  <li>Last names (surname, family name)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Each author should list an associated department, university, or organizational affiliation and its location,
  including city, state/province (if applicable), and country. If the article has been submitted on behalf of a
  consortium, all author names and affiliations should be listed at the end of the article.</p>

<p><b>This information cannot be changed after initial submission, so please ensure that it is correct.</b></p>

<p>To qualify for authorship, a researcher should contribute to <b>all</b> of the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Conception and design of the work, acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data</li>
  <li>Drafting the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content</li>
  <li>Final approval of the version to be published</li>
</ol>

<p>All persons designated as authors should qualify for authorship, and all those who qualify should be listed. Each
  author must have participated sufficiently in the work to take public responsibility for appropriate portions of the
  content. Those who contributed to the work but do not qualify for authorship should be listed in the
  acknowledgments.</p>

<p>When a large group or center has conducted the work, the author list should include the individuals whose
  contributions meet the criteria defined above, as well as the group name.</p>

<p>One author should be designated as the corresponding author, and his or her email address or other contact
  information should be included on the manuscript cover page. This information will be published with the article if
  accepted.</p>

<p>See the <a href="editorial#authorship"><i>PLOS ONE</i> Editorial Policy regarding authorship criteria</a> for more
  information.</p>

<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

<a name="authors" id="authors"></a>

</ul>
</p>

<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

<a name="materials" id="materials"></a>
<h3>Materials and Methods</h3>
<p>This section should provide enough detail to allow suitably skilled investigators to fully replicate your study.
  Specific information and/or protocols for new methods should be included in detail. If materials, methods, and
  protocols are well established, authors may cite articles where those protocols are described in detail, but the
  submission should include sufficient information to be understood independent of these references. </p>

<p>We encourage authors to submit detailed protocols for newer or less well-established methods as Supporting
  Information. Further
  information about formatting Supporting Information files, can be found <a href="supportingInformation">here</a>.</p>

<p>Methods sections of papers on research using <b>human or animal subjects and/or tissue or field sampling</b> must
  include required ethics statements. See the <a href="#human">Reporting Guidelines for human research</a>, <a
    href="#clinical">clinical trials</a>, <a href="#animal">animal research</a>, and <a href="#observational">observational
    and field studies</a> for more information. </p>

<p>Methods sections of papers with <b>data that should be deposited in a publicly available database</b> should specify
  where the data have been deposited and provide the relevant accession numbers and version numbers, if appropriate.
  Accession numbers should be provided in parentheses after the entity on first use. If the accession numbers have not
  yet been obtained at the time of submission, please state that they will be provided during review. They must be
  provided prior to publication. A list of recommended repositories for different types of data can be found <a href="http://www.plosone.org/static/editorial#sharing">here</a>.</p>

<p>Methods sections of papers using <b>cell lines</b> must state the origin of the cell lines used. See the <a
  href="#cell">Reporting Guidelines for cell line research</a> for more information. </p>

<p>Methods sections of papers adding <b>new taxon names</b> to the literature must follow the Reporting Guidelines below
  for a new <a href="#zoological">zoological taxon</a>, <a href="#botanical">botanical taxon</a>, or <a href="#fungal">fungal
    taxon</a>. </p>

<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

<a name="results" id="results"></a>
<h3>Results, Discussion, and Conclusions</h3>
<p>These sections may all be separate, or may be combined to create a mixed Results/Discussion section (commonly labeled
  "Results and Discussion") or a mixed Discussion/Conclusions section (commonly labeled "Discussion"). These sections
  may be further divided into subsections, each with a concise subheading, as appropriate. These sections have no word
  limit, but the language should be clear and concise. </p>

<p>Together, these sections should describe the results of the experiments, the interpretation of these results, and the
  conclusions that can be drawn. Authors should explain how the results relate to the hypothesis presented as the basis
  of the study and provide a succinct explanation of the implications of the findings, particularly in relation to
  previous related studies and potential future directions for research. </p>

<p><i>PLOS ONE</i> editorial decisions do not rely on perceived significance or impact, so authors should avoid
  overstating their conclusions. See the <i>PLOS ONE</i> <a href="publication#data support">Publication Criteria</a> for
  more information.</p>

<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

<a name="acks" id="acks"></a>
<h3>Acknowledgments</h3>
<p>People who contributed to the work but do not fit the <a href="editorial#authorship"><i>PLOS ONE</i> authorship
  criteria</a> should be listed in the acknowledgments, along with their contributions. You must ensure that anyone
  named in the acknowledgments agrees to being so named. </p>

<p>Funding sources should <b>not</b> be included in the acknowledgments, or anywhere in the manuscript file. You will
  provide this information during the manuscript submission process.</p>

<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

<a name="references" id="references"></a>
<h3>References</h3>
<p>Only published or accepted manuscripts should be included in the reference list. Manuscripts that have been submitted
  but not yet accepted should not be cited. Limited citation of unpublished work should be included in the body of the
  text only as &ldquo;unpublished data.&rdquo;</p>

<p>References must be listed at the end of the manuscript and numbered in the order that they appear in the text. In the
  text, citations should be indicated by the reference number in brackets. Journal name abbreviations should be those
  found in the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nlmcatalog/journals">NCBI databases</a>. A number of reference
  software companies supply PLOS style files (e.g., <a href="http://www.refman.com/rmhome.asp">Reference Manager</a>, <a
    href="http://www.endnote.com/">EndNote</a>). </p>

<h3>Figure Legends</h3>

<p>Figures should <b>not</b> be included in the manuscript file, but figure legends should be. Guidelines for preparing
  figures can be found <a href="figureGuidelines">here</a>.</p>

<p>Figure legends should describe the key messages of a figure. Legends should have a short title of 15 words or less.
  The full legend should have a description of the figure and allow readers to understand the figure without referring
  to the text. The legend itself should be succinct, avoid lengthy descriptions of methods, and define all non-standard
  symbols and abbreviations. </p>

<p>Further information about figure legends can be found in the <a href="figureGuidelines#titles">Figure Guidelines</a>.
</p>

<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

<a name="striking" id="striking"></a>
<h3>Striking Images</h3>

<p>Authors are encouraged to upload a "striking image" that may be used to represent their paper online in places like the journal homepage or in search results. The striking image must be derived from a figure or supporting information file from the paper, ie. a cropped portion of an image or the entire image. Striking images should ideally be high resolution, eye-catching, single panel images, and should ideally avoid containing added details such as text, scale bars, and arrows. If no striking image is uploaded, a figure from the paper will be designated as the striking image.</p>

<p>Please keep in mind that PLOS's <a href="http://www.plosone.org/static/figureGuidelines#ccal">Creative Commons Attribution License</a> applies to striking images. As such, do not submit any figures or photos that have been previously copyrighted unless you have express written permission from the copyright holder to publish under the CCAL license. Note that all published materials in PLOS ONE are freely available online, and any third party is permitted to read, download, copy, distribute, and use these materials in any way, even commercially, with proper attribution.</p>

<p>
Care should be taken with the following image types in particular:</p>

<ol>
<li>PLOS ONE is unable to publish any images generated by Google software (Google Maps, Street View, and Earth)
</li>
<li>Maps in general are usually copyrighted, especially satellite maps
</li>
<li>Photographs
</li>
<li>Commercial or government images, slogans, or logos
</li>
<li>Images from Facebook or Twitter
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Authors must also take special care when submitting manuscripts that contain potentially identifying images of people. Identifying information should not be included in the manuscript unless the information is crucial and the individual has provided written consent by completing the <a href="http://www.plosone.org/static/plos_consent_form.pdf">Consent Form for Publication in a PLOS Journal</a> (PDF).

<h2>3. Specific Reporting Guidelines</h2>

<a name="human" id="human"></a>
<h3>Human Subject Research</h3>

<p>Methods sections of papers on research using human subject or samples must include ethics statements that specify:
<ul>
  <li>The name of the approving institutional review board or equivalent committee(s). If approval was not obtained, the
    authors must provide a detailed statement explaining why it was not needed
  </li>
  <li>Whether informed consent was written or oral. If informed consent was oral, it must be stated in the manuscript:
    <ul>
      <li>Why written consent could not be obtained</li>
      <li>That the Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved use of oral consent</li>
      <li>How oral consent was documented</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
</p>

<p>For studies involving humans categorized by race/ethnicity, age, disease/disabilities, religion, sex/gender, sexual
  orientation, or other socially constructed groupings, authors should:
<ul>
  <li>Explicitly describe their methods of categorizing human populations</li>
  <li>Define categories in as much detail as the study protocol allows</li>
  <li>Justify their choices of definitions and categories, including for example whether any rules of human
    categorization were required by their funding agency
  </li>
  <li>Explain whether (and if so, how) they controlled for confounding variables such as socioeconomic status,
    nutrition, environmental exposures, or similar factors in their analysis
  </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>In addition, outmoded terms and potentially stigmatizing labels should be changed to more current, acceptable
  terminology. Examples: "Caucasian" should be changed to "white" or "of [Western] European descent" (as appropriate);
  "cancer victims" should be changed to "patients with cancer." </p>

<p>For papers that include identifying, or potentially identifying, information, authors must download the <a
  href="plos_consent_form.pdf">Consent Form for Publication in a PLOS Journal</a> (PDF), which the individual, parent,
  or guardian must sign once they have read the paper and been informed about the terms of PLOS open-access license. The
  signed consent form should not be submitted with the manuscript, but authors should securely file it in the
  individual's case notes and the methods section of the manuscript should explicitly state that consent authorization
  for publication is on file, using wording like:
<ul>
  <p><b>The individual in this manuscript has given written informed consent (as outlined in PLOS consent form) to
    publish these case details.</b></p>
</ul>

<p>For more information about <i>PLOS ONE</i> policies regarding human subject research, see the <a
  href="publication#ethical">Publication Criteria</a> and <a href="editorial#human">Editorial Policies</a>. </p>

<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

<a name="clinical" id="clinical"></a>
<h3>Clinical Trials</h3>

<p>Authors of manuscripts describing the results of clinical trials must adhere to the <a
  href="http://www.consort-statement.org/">CONSORT</a> reporting guidelines appropriate to their trial design, available
  on the <a href="http://www.consort-statement.org/consort-statement/">CONSORT Statement website</a>. Before the paper
  can enter peer review, authors must:
<ol>
  <li>Provide the registry name and number in the methods section of the manuscript</li>
  <li>Provide a copy of the trial protocol as approved by the ethics committee and a completed <a
    href="http://www.consort-statement.org/consort-statement/">CONSORT checklist</a> as Supporting Information (which
    will be published alongside the paper, if accepted)
  </li>
  <li>Include the <a href="http://www.consort-statement.org/consort-statement/flow-diagram0/">CONSORT flow diagram</a>
    as the manuscript's "Figure 1"
  </li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>Any deviation from the trial protocol must be explained in the paper. Authors must explicitly discuss informed
  consent in their paper, and we reserve the right to ask for a copy of the patient consent form. </p>

<p>The methods section must include the name of the registry, the registry number, and the URL of your trial in the
  registry database for each location in which the trial is registered. </p>

<p>For more information about <i>PLOS ONE</i> policies regarding clinical trials, see the <a href="editorial#clinical">Editorial
  Policies</a>. </p>

<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

<a name="animal" id="animal"></a>
<h3>Animal Research</h3>

<p>Methods sections of manuscripts reporting results of animal research must include required ethics statements that
  specify:
<ul>
  <li>The full name of the relevant ethics committee that approved the work, and the associated permit number(s) (where
    ethical approval is not required, the manuscript should include a clear statement of this and the reason why)
  </li>
  <li>Relevant details for efforts taken to ameliorate animal suffering</li>
</ul></p>

<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
  <b>This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of
    Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The protocol was approved by the Committee on the Ethics of
    Animal Experiments of the University of Minnesota (Permit Number: 27-2956). All surgery was performed under sodium
    pentobarbital anesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering.</b>
</ul>

<p>The organism(s) studied should always be stated in the abstract. Where research may be confused as pertaining to
  clinical research, the animal model should also be stated in the title. </p>

<p>We ask authors to follow the <a href="http://www.nc3rs.org.uk/page.asp?id=1357">ARRIVE (Animal Research: Reporting
  of <i>In Vivo</i> Experiments) guidelines</a> for all submissions describing laboratory-based animal research and to upload a completed <a href="http://www.nc3rs.org.uk/page.asp?id=1357">ARRIVE Guidelines Checklist</a> to be published as supporting information. Please note that inclusion of a completed ARRIVE Checklist will be a formal requirement for publication at a later date.</p>

<h3>Observational and Field Studies</h3>

<p>Methods sections for submissions reporting on any type of field study must include ethics statements that specify:
<ul>
  <li>Permits and approvals obtained for the work, including the full name of the authority that approved the study; if
    none were required, authors should explain why
  <li>Whether the land accessed is privately owned or protected</li>
  <li>Whether any protected species were sampled</li>
  <li>Full details of animal husbandry, experimentation, and care/welfare, where relevant</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Cell Line Research</h3>

<p>Methods sections for submissions reporting on research with cell lines should state the origin of any cell lines. For
  established cell lines the provenance should be stated and references must also be given to either a published paper
  or to a commercial source. If previously unpublished <i>de novo</i> cell lines were used, including those gifted from
  another laboratory, details of institutional review board or ethics committee approval must be given, and confirmation
  of written informed consent must be provided if the line is of human origin.</p>

<h3>Systematic Review/Meta-Analysis</h3>

<p>A systematic review paper, as defined by <a href="http://www.cochrane.org/">The Cochrane Collaboration</a>, is a
  review of a clearly formulated question that uses explicit, systematic methods to identify, select, and critically
  appraise relevant research, and to collect and analyze data from the studies that are included in the review. These
  reviews differ substantially from narrative-based reviews or synthesis articles. Statistical methods (meta-analysis)
  may or may not be used to analyze and summarize the results of the included studies.</p>

<p>Reports of systematic reviews and meta-analyses must include a completed <a
  href="http://www.prisma-statement.org/statement.htm">PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
  Meta-Analyses) checklist and flow diagram</a> to accompany the main text. Blank templates are available here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Checklist: <a href=" http://www.prisma-statement.org/2.1.2%20-%20PRISMA%202009%20Checklist.pdf">PDF</a> or <a
    href="http://www.prisma-statement.org/2.1.1%20-%20PRISMA%202009%20Checklist.doc">Word document</a></li>
  <li>Flow diagram: <a href="http://www.prisma-statement.org/2.1.4%20-%20PRISMA%20Flow%202009%20Diagram.pdf">PDF</a> or
    <a href="http://www.prisma-statement.org/2.1.3%20-%20PRISMA%202009%20Flow%20Diagram.doc">Word document</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Authors must also state in their "Methods" section whether a protocol exists for their systematic review, and if so,
  provide a copy of the protocol as Supporting Information and provide the registry number in the abstract. </p>

<p>If your article is a Systematic Review or a Meta-Analysis you should:
<ul>
  <li>State this in your cover letter</li>
  <li>Select "Research Article" as your article type when submitting</li>
  <li>Include the PRISMA flowchart as Figure 1 (required where applicable)</li>
  <li>Include the PRISMA checklist as Supporting Information</li>
</ul>

</p>

<p>You will need to contact <a href="http://zoobank.org/">Zoobank</a> to obtain a GUID (LSID). Please do this as early
  as possible to avoid delay of publication upon acceptance of your manuscript. It is your responsibility to provide us
  with this information so we can include it in the final published paper.</p>

<p>Please also insert the following text into the <b>Methods</b> section, in a sub-section to be called "Nomenclatural
  Acts":
<blockquote><b>
  <p>The electronic edition of this article conforms to the requirements of the amended International Code of Zoological
    Nomenclature, and hence the new names contained herein are available under that Code from the electronic edition of
    this article. This published work and the nomenclatural acts it contains have been registered in ZooBank, the online
    registration system for the ICZN. The ZooBank LSIDs (Life Science Identifiers) can be resolved and the associated

<h3>New Botanical Taxon</h3>

<p>When publishing papers that describe a new botanical taxon, PLOS aims to comply with the requirements of the
  International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN). In association with the <a
    href="http://www.ipni.org/">International Plant Names Index</a> (IPNI), the following guidelines for publication in
  an online-only journal have been agreed such that any scientific botanical name published by us is considered
  effectively published under the rules of the Code. Please note that these guidelines differ from those for zoological nomenclature, and apply only to seed plants, ferns, and lycophytes.</p>

<p>Effective January 2012, "the description or diagnosis required for valid publication of the name of a new taxon" can
  be in either Latin or English. This does not affect the requirements for scientific names, which are still to be
  Latin.</p>

<p>Also effective January 2012, the electronic PDF represents a published work according to the ICN for algae, fungi,
  and plants. Therefore the new names contained in the electronic publication of a <i>PLOS ONE</i> article are
  effectively published under that Code from the electronic edition alone, so there is no longer any need to provide
  printed copies. </p>

<p>Additional information describing recent changes to the Code can be found <a
  href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/250">here</a>.</p>

<p>For proper registration of the new taxon, we require two specific statements to be included in your manuscript. </p>

<p>In the <b>Results</b> section, the globally unique identifier (GUID), currently in the form of a Life Science
  Identifier (LSID), should be listed under the new species name, for example:</p>
<dl>
  <dd><b>Solanum aspersum</b> S.Knapp, sp. nov. [urn:lsid:ipni.org:names:77103633-1] Type: Colombia. Putumayo: vertiente
    oriental de la Cordillera, entre Sachamates y San Francisco de Sibundoy, 1600-1750 m, 30 Dec 1940, J. Cuatrecasas
    11471 (holotype, COL; isotypes, F [F-1335119], US [US-1799731]).
  </dd>
</dl>

<p><i>PLOS ONE</i> staff will contact IPNI to obtain the GUID (LSID) after your manuscript is accepted for publication,
  and this information will then be added to the manuscript during the production phase</p>

<p>In the <b>Methods</b> section, include a sub-section called "Nomenclature" using the following wording:</p>

<blockquote><b>
  <p>The electronic version of this article in Portable Document Format (PDF) in a work with an ISSN or ISBN will
    represent a published work according to the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants, and
    hence the new names contained in the electronic publication of a <i>PLOS ONE</i> article are effectively published
    under that Code from the electronic edition alone, so there is no longer any need to provide printed copies.</p>

  <p>In addition, new names contained in this work have been submitted to IPNI, from where they will be made available
    to the Global Names Index. The IPNI LSIDs can be resolved and the associated information viewed through any standard
    web browser by appending the LSID contained in this publication to the prefix http://ipni.org/. The online version
    of this work is archived and available from the following digital repositories: [INSERT NAMES OF DIGITAL
    REPOSITORIES WHERE ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT WILL BE SUBMITTED (PubMed Central, LOCKSS etc)].</p>

<h3>New Fungal Taxon</h3>

<p>When publishing papers that describe a new fungal taxon name, PLOS aims to comply with the requirements of the
  International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN). The following guidelines for publication in an
  online-only journal have been agreed such that any scientific fungal name published by us is considered effectively
  published under the rules of the Code. Please note that these guidelines differ from those for zoological
  nomenclature.</p>

<p>Effective January 2012, "the description or diagnosis required for valid publication of the name of a new taxon" can
  be in either Latin or English. This does not affect the requirements for scientific names, which are still to be
  Latin.</p>

<p>Also effective January 2012, the electronic PDF represents a published work according to the ICN for algae, fungi,

<p>You will need to contact either <a href="http://www.mycobank.org/">Mycobank</a> or <a
  href="http://www.indexfungorum.org/">Index Fungorum</a> to obtain the GUID (LSID). Please do this as early as possible
  to avoid delay of publication upon acceptance of your manuscript. It is your responsibility to provide us with this
  information so we can include it in the final published paper. Effective January 2013, all papers describing new
  fungal species must reference the identifier issued by a recognized repository in the protologue in order to be
  considered effectively published.</p>

<p>In the <b>Methods</b> section, include a sub-section called "Nomenclature" using the following wording (this example
  is for taxon names submitted to MycoBank; please substitute appropriately if you have submitted to Index Fungorum):
</p>

<blockquote><b>

<h3>Qualitative Research</h3>

<p>Qualitative research studies use non-quantitative methods to address a defined research question that may not be
  accessible by quantitative methods, such as people's interpretations, experiences, and perspectives. The analysis
  methods are explicit, systematic, and reproducible, but the results do not involve numerical values or use statistics.
  Examples of qualitative data sources include, but are not limited to, interviews, text documents, audio/video
  recordings, and free-form answers to questionnaires and surveys. </p>

<p>Qualitative research studies should be reported in accordance to the <a
  href="http://intqhc.oxfordjournals.org/content/19/6/349.long">Consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research
  (COREQ)</a> <a href="http://intqhc.oxfordjournals.org/content/19/6/349/T1.expansion.html">checklist</a>. Further
  reporting guidelines can be found in the Equator Network's <a
    href="http://www.equator-network.org/resource-centre/library-of-health-research-reporting/reporting-guidelines/qualitative-research/">Guidelines
    for reporting qualitative research</a>.</p>
