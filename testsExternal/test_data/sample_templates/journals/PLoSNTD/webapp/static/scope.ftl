<h1><em>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</em> Journal Scope</h1> 

<p class="intro"><em>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</em> is an open access journal devoted to the pathology, epidemiology, prevention, treatment and control of the neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), as well as public policy relevant to this group of diseases. The NTDs are defined as a group of poverty-promoting chronic infectious diseases, which primarily occur in rural areas and poor urban areas of low-income and middle-income countries. They are poverty-promoting because of their impact on child health and development, pregnancy, and worker productivity, as well as their stigmatizing features.</p> 

<p>The major NTDs that are within the scope of <em>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases </em>are listed below:</p> 

<h2>Protozoan Infections</h2> 
<ul> 
  <li>Amebiasis</li> 
  <li>Balantidiasis</li> 
  <li>Chagas Disease</li> 
  <li>Giardiasis</li>
  <li>Human African Trypanosomiasis</li> 
  <li>Leishmaniasis</li> 
</ul> 

<h2>Helminth Infections</h2> 
<ul> 
  <li>Taeniasis-Cysticercosis</li> 
  <li>Dracunculiasis</li> 
  <li>Echinococcosis</li> 
  <li>Food-borne Trematodiases</li> 
  <li>Loiasis</li> 
  <li>Lymphatic Filariasis</li> 
  <li>Onchocerciasis</li> 
  <li>Schistosomiasis</li> 
  <li>Soil-transmitted Helminthiases (Ascariasis, Hookworm Diseases, Trichuriasis, Strongyloidiasis)</li> 
  <li>Toxocariasis and other Larva Migrans</li>
</ul> 

<h2>Viral Infections</h2>
<ul> 
  <li>Dengue</li> 
  <li>Japanese encephalitis</li> 
  <li>Jungle yellow fever</li> 
  <li>Other arboviral infections</li> 
  <li>Rabies</li> 
  <li>Rift Valley fever</li> 
  <li>Viral hemorrhagic fevers</li>
</ul> 

<h2>Bacterial Infections</h2> 
<ul> 
  <li>Bartonella</li>
  <li>Bovine Tuberculosis in Humans</li>
  <li>Buruli Ulcer</li> 
  <li>Cholera</li> 
  <li>Enteric pathogens (Shigella, Salmonella, <em>E. coli</em>)</li> 
  <li>Leprosy</li> 
  <li>Leptospirosis</li> 
  <li>Relapsing Fever</li>
  <li>Trachoma</li> 
  <li>Treponematoses (Bejel, Pinta, Syphilis, Yaws)</li> 
</ul> 

<h2>Fungal Infections</h2> 
<ul> 
  <li>Mycetoma</li>
  <li>Paracoccidiomycosis</li>
</ul> 

<h2>Ectoparasitic Infections</h2> 
<ul> 
  <li>Scabies</li>
  <li>Myiasis</li> 
</ul> 

<h2>Areas of Emphasis</h2>
<p>All aspects of these diseases will be considered, including their pathogenesis, clinical features, pharmacology and treatment, diagnosis, epidemiology, vector biology, and vaccinology and prevention.  Demographic, ecological and social determinants, public health, and policy aspects of these diseases (including cost-effectiveness analyses) will also be a priority.  <em>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</em> is pleased to publish relevant in vitro and animal studies as well as human investigations.</p> 

<p>The journal is organized to provide additional support for authors from endemic countries and such authors are particularly encouraged to submit their research to <em>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</em>.</p>

<h2>Nutritional Diseases</h2>
<p>Papers that examine the link between nutrition and NTD infection will be considered for <em>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</em>.</p> 

<h2>HIV/AIDS, Malaria, and Tuberculosis</h2>
<p>The &quot;big three&quot; diseases, HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, will not generally be considered for <em>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</em>. 
Authors of papers on these three diseases should continue to submit them to one of the seven other PLOS journals as appropriate. 
An important exception is when these three diseases are considered in the context of co-infections with the NTDs. 
For example, <em>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</em> is interested in papers that explore integrated control of the NTDs and the &quot;big three&quot;diseases. 
Additionally, <em>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</em> will consider papers on all aspects of bovine tuberculosis affecting humans, and, on a case-by-case basis, papers on vivax malaria and related topics.</p> 

<h2>Fundamental Microbial Pathogenesis</h2>
<p> It is recommended that papers on fundamental microbial pathogenesis and the molecular and cellular biology of the NTDs pathogens should be considered for <em>PLOS Pathogens</em>. Examples of papers that might be more appropriate for <em>PLOS Pathogens</em> would be papers on fundamental mechanisms of immune evasion by <em>Plasmodium</em>, blocking of apoptosis by <em>Salmonella</em>, population biology of <em>Candida</em>, or latency in herpes viruses. In contrast, papers examining molecular pathways as potential drug or vaccine targets would be more suitable for <em>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</em>. As described above, other papers more suitable to <em>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</em> are papers on health product (i.e., drug, diagnostic, and vaccine) development, human immunology, clinical manifestations, surveillance and epidemiologic research, public health control, and health policy aspects of the NTDs.</p> 

<h2>Other Infections</h2>
<p>Other infectious diseases will also be considered on a case-by-case basis through a <a href="guidelines#presubmission" title="PLOS NTDs | Author Guidelines: Presubmission Inquiries">presubmission inquiry</a> to the editors. Authors should indicate in their pre-submission inquiry why they consider the infection to be a neglected tropical disease.</p>

<h2>Public Policy</h2>

<p>In addition to scientific and medical investigative articles, <em>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</em> is committed to all aspects of the NTDs that are relevant to global public health, including important public policy statements.</p> 

<p>Accordingly, <em>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</em> will have an engaging magazine section with dedicated editors. The magazine section will contain opinion pieces, debates, policy papers, expert commentaries on research articles, reviews, problem-based educational articles (from the laboratory, clinic, and field), interviews, and historical profiles and perspectives.</p>
