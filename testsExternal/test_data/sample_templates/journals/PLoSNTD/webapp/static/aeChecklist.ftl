<h1><em>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</em> Associate Editor Checklist</h1> 

<h2>Manuscript Type/Content and Action Required</h2>

<h3>Any study involving human participants </h3>
<p>The study must have been approved by an explicitly named IRB, and patients must have given written informed consent for participation.  If consent is not written, the authors must explain why. PLOS reserves the right to ask for a copy of the patient consent form. If a patient is identifiable, then specific consent for publication must be provided.</p>

<h3>Clinical trial</h3>
<p><strong>Before peer review:</strong> Authors of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) must adhere to the <a href="http://www.consort-statement.org/" title="Consort-Statement.org">CONSORT</a> reporting guidelines and provide the following before the paper can enter peer review: trial registry, trial registration number, and IRB must all be named in the paper; a copy of the trial protocol and a completed CONSORT checklist and flowchart must be provided as supporting files. Any deviation from the trial protocol must be explained in the paper. Authors must explicitly discuss informed consent in their paper, and PLOS reserves the right to ask for a copy of the patient consent form. For other types of trials (e.g. non-randomized), authors must also provide trial registration details and the trial protocol but they do not need to follow the CONSORT guidelines.</p>
<p><strong>If paper makes it to Minor Revision:</strong> AE should select "Minor Revision-clinical trial" letter template to send to the author. If the trial was not an RCT, please delete the section requesting that authors follow the CONSORT guidelines.</p>

<h3>Systematic review</h3>
<p><strong>Before peer review:</strong> AE should assign at least one reviewer who is an expert in conducting systematic reviews. </p>
<p><strong>If paper makes it to Minor Revision:</strong> Systematic reviews must be reported according to the <a href="http://www.consort-statement.org/QUOROM.pdf" title="Consort-Statement.org | The QUOROM Statement Checklist (27KB PDF)">QUOROM</a> guidelines (adapted for the relevant type of study being systematically reviewed), and the QUOROM checklist must be completed and attached as a supporting file. </p> 

<h3>Qualitative study</h3>
<p><strong>Before peer review:</strong> AE should assign at least one reviewer who is an expert in qualitative research methods. The study must have been approved by an IRB, and patients must have given informed consent for participation. PLOS reserves the right to ask for a copy of the patient consent form.</p>

<h3>Methodology outside AE's area of expertise (e.g., cost-effectiveness analysis, mathematical modeling, etc.)</h3>
<p><strong>Before peer review:</strong> AE should assign at least one reviewer who specializes in the appropriate field.</p>

<h3>Retrospective Analysis of Patient Data</h3>
<p>In general, studies that retrospectively analyze patient data that were collected as a routine part of patient treatment do not require IRB approval.  However, authors must reassure us that they asked their IRB if they could study these patient data and that their IRB agreed that no specific approval was required.    Authors should send a copy of the IRB's exemption letter.</p>

<h3>Diagnostic test</h3>
<p><strong>If paper makes it to Minor Revision:</strong> Authors must adhere to the <a href="http://www.consort-statement.org/stardstatement.htm" title="Consort-Statement.org | The STARD Initiative">STARD</a> guidelines for reporting their study, and the STARD checklist must be completed and attached as a supporting file. </p>

<h3>Observational epidemiological study (case-control, cohort, cross-sectional)</h3>
<p><strong>If paper makes it to Minor Revision:</strong> Authors should follow the <a href="http://www.strobe-statement.org/" title="Strobe-Statement.org | STROBE Initiative">STROBE</a> guidelines, and the STROBE checklist must be completed and attached as a supporting file.</p>

<h3>Microarray experiment </h3>
<p><strong>If paper makes it to Minor Revision: </strong>Reports of microarray experiments should conform to the <a href="http://www.mged.org/Workgroups/MIAME/miame.html" title="MGED.org | MIAME Guidelines">MIAME</a> guidelines, and the data from the experiments must be deposited in a publicly accessible database, such as GEO or Array Express.</p>

<h3>Statistics</h3>
<p><strong>Before Minor Revision letter is sent out:</strong> If the paper includes statistical calculations, AE should notify <strong>plosntds [at] plos.org</strong> through the JMS ("Send Manuscript Correspondence") that the paper is in need of a statistical review. We will then invite a statistical reviewer as a fourth reviewer on the paper. The statistical review must be completed before the AE can send the Minor Revision decision letter to the author.</p>

<h3>English as a second language</h3>
<p><strong>If paper makes it to Minor Revision:</strong> If the paper has serious English-language (not minor grammatical) problems, the AE should notify <strong>plosntds [at] plos.org</strong> through the JMS ("Send Manuscript Correspondence") that the paper needs language editing.</p>
