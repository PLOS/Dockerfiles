<a name="about"></a>
<h2>1. About <em>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</em></h2>

<p><em>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</em> is an open-access journal devoted to the pathobiology, epidemiology, prevention, treatment, and control of the neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), as well as public policy relevant to this group of diseases. The NTDs are defined as a group of poverty-promoting chronic infectious diseases, which primarily occur in rural areas and poor urban areas of low-income and middle-income countries. They are poverty-promoting because of their impact on child health and development, pregnancy, and worker productivity, as well as their stigmatizing features. The major NTDs that are within the scope of <em>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</em> can be found in the <a href="scope" title="Journal Scope">description of the journal's scope</a>.</p>

<p>All aspects of these diseases will be considered, including their pathogenesis, clinical features, pharmacology and treatment, diagnosis, epidemiology, vector biology, and vaccinology and prevention. Demographic, ecological and social determinants, public health, and policy aspects of these diseases (including cost-effectiveness analyses) will also be a priority. <em>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</em> is pleased to publish relevant in vitro and animal studies as well as human investigations. </p>

<p>The journal is organized to provide additional support for authors from endemic countries, and such authors are particularly encouraged to submit their research to <em>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</em>.</p>


<a name="criteria"></a>
<h2>2. Criteria for Publication</h2>

<p>Manuscripts should represent a significant advance in terms of:</p>
<ul> 
<li>Originality</li> 
<li>Importance to researchers or practitioners in the field</li> 
<li>Interest for researchers or practitioners outside the field</li> 
<li>Rigorous methodology with substantial evidence for its conclusions</li>
<li>Conducted according to the highest ethical standards</li>
</ul>

<a name="review"></a>
<h2>3. The Review Process</h2>

<p>Submitted manuscripts will be assigned to one of the <em>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</em> Deputy Editors. If the paper is deemed to be within the scope of the journal with regard to content and of a minimum quality an academic editor with expertise in the relevant area, usually one of the Associate Editors on our <a href="edboard" title="Editorial Board">editorial board</a>, is then also assigned to the paper. The Deputy Editor and Associate Editor will promptly assess the manuscript and will decide if it is likely to meet the requirement of providing a major advance in a particular field and describing a sufficient body of work to support that claim; if so, it will be sent out for peer review. The professional and academic editors then together make a decision based on the reviewers' comments. There are several types of decision possible:</p>
<ul> 
<li>Accept the manuscript as submitted</li> 
<li>Accept it with minor revision</li> 
<li>Invite the authors to submit a major revision of the manuscript before a final decision is reached</li> 
<li>Reject, typically because it does not fit the criteria outlined above of originality, importance to the field, cross-discipline interest, or sound methodology</li>
</ul>
 
<p>When differences of opinion occur between reviewers, the Deputy Editor and the Associate Editor weigh all comments and arrive at a balanced decision based on all comments. To assist in this process, the reviewer should provide the editors with as much information as possible. A review that clearly outlines reasons both for and against publication is therefore of as much, or even more, value as one that makes a direct recommendation. </p>

<p>If reviewers appear to disagree fundamentally, the editors may choose to share all the reviews with each of the reviewers and by this means elicit additional comment that may help the editors to make a decision. The Deputy and Associate Editors then assess the recommendations and comments of the reviewers alongside comments by the authors and material that may not have been made available to those reviewers.</p>
 
<p>When a paper has been revised in response to comments by reviewers or when authors feel their argument has been misconstrued in review, we ask reviewers to offer additional comments on the revised or contested manuscript. We request that reviewers make themselves available to provide such follow-up advice. We are nevertheless aware that reviewers do not wish to be involved in extended discussions over papers, and we keep such consultations to a minimum while still allowing authors a fair hearing.</p>

<a name="reviewer"></a> 
<h2>4. Reviewer Selection</h2>

<p>We decide on reviewers for a particular manuscript based on many factors, including expertise, reputation, specific recommendations of authors and Associate Editors, and the Deputy Editor's own knowledge of a reviewer.</p>
 
<p>As part of our editorial procedure, we regularly confer with potential reviewers before sending them manuscripts to review. Reviewers should bear in mind that even these initial messages or conversations contain confidential information.</p>

<a name="writing"></a> 
<h2>5. Writing the Review</h2>

<p>The purpose of the review is to provide the academic and professional editors with an expert opinion regarding the quality of the manuscript under consideration, and should also supply authors with explicit feedback on how to improve their papers so that they will be acceptable for publication in <em>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</em>. Although confidential comments to the editors are respected, any remarks that might help to strengthen the paper should be directed to the authors themselves. The best possible review would answer the following questions:</p>
<ul> 
<li>What are the main claims of the paper and how important are they?</li> 
<li>Are these claims novel? If not, please specify papers that weaken the claims to the originality of this one.</li> 
<li>Are the claims properly placed in the context of the previous literature?</li> 
<li>Do the results support the claims? If not, what other evidence is required?</li> 
<li>If a protocol is provided, for example for a randomized controlled trial, are there any important deviations from it? If so, have the authors explained adequately why the deviations occurred?</li>
<li>Would any other experiments or additional information improve the paper? How much better would the paper be if this extra work was done, and how difficult would such work be to do, or to provide?</li> 
<li>Is this paper outstanding in its discipline? (For example, would you like to see this work presented in a seminar at your hospital or university? Do you feel these results need to be incorporated in your next general lecture on the subject?) If yes, what makes it outstanding? If not, why not?</li> 
<li>Who would find this paper of interest? Why?</li> 
<li>If the paper is considered unsuitable for publication in its present form, does the study itself show sufficient enough potential that the authors should be encouraged to resubmit a revised version?</li> 
</ul>

<a name="other"></a>
<h2>6. Other Questions for Consideration</h2>

<p>In the case of manuscripts deemed worthy of consideration, we would appreciate additional advice from the reviewer on the following:</p>
<ul> 
<li>Is the manuscript clearly enough written so that it is understandable to non-specialists? If not, how could it be improved?</li> 
<li>Have the authors provided adequate proof for their claims without overselling them? 
<li>Have the authors cited the previous literature appropriately?</li> 
<li>Does the paper offer enough details of its methodology that its experiments or its analyses could be reproduced?</li> 
<li><em>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</em> encourages authors to publish detailed methods as supporting information online. Do any particular methods used in the manuscript warrant such publication?</li>
</ul> 

<a name="confidentiality"></a>
<h2>7. Confidentiality</h2>

<p>The review process is strictly confidential and should be treated as such by reviewers. Because the author may have chosen to exclude some people from this process, no one not directly involved with the manuscript, including colleagues or other experts in the field, should be consulted by the reviewer unless such consultations have first been discussed with the Deputy Editor.</p>

<a name="timely"></a> 
<h2>8. Timely Review</h2>

<p><em>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</em> believes that an efficient editorial process that results in timely publication provides a valuable service both to authors and to the community at large. We therefore request that reviewers respond promptly, usually within 2 weeks of receipt of a manuscript. If reviewers need more time, we request that they contact us promptly so that we can keep the authors informed and, if necessary, assign alternate reviewers.</p>

<a name="anonymity"></a> 
<h2>9. Anonymity</h2>

<p><em>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</em> encourages open (non-anonymous) peer-review. As a default, we will pass a reviewer's name on to the authors along with the comments. However, if reviewers do not wish to have their name revealed, we will honor that request. We discourage any attempt on the part of authors to discover the identity of any reviewer or to contact this person directly. We encourage the reviewers to adopt the same policy. The Associate Editor is also anonymous to authors and reviewers unless and until a manuscript is accepted for publication. The Associate Editor's name is then indicated in the published article.</p>

<a name="editing"></a> 
<h2>10. Editing Reviewers' Reports</h2>

<p>The editors and PLOS staff do not edit any comments made by reviewers that are intended to be read by the authors unless the language is deemed inappropriate for professional communication or the comments contain information considered confidential. Such remarks should be reserved for the confidential section of the review form, which is intended to be read by the editors only. In their comments to authors, reviewers are encouraged to be honest but not offensive in their language. On the other hand, authors should not confuse frank and perhaps even robust language with unfair criticism.</p> 

<a name="competing"></a>
<h2>11. Competing Interests</h2>

<p>As far as possible we respect requests by authors to exclude reviewers whom they consider to be unsuitable. We also, as much as possible, try to rule out those reviewers who may have an obvious competing interest, such as those who may have been collaborators on other projects with the authors of the manuscript under review, those who may be direct competitors, those who may have a known history of antipathy with the author(s), or those who might profit financially from the work. Because it is not possible for all such competing interests to be known by a particular editor, we request that reviewers who recognize a potential competing interest inform the editors or journal staff and recuse themselves if they feel that are unable to offer an impartial review.</p>
 
<p>Read more about PLOS's <a href="competing" title="PLOS policy regarding competing interests">Competing Interests Policy</a>.</a> When submitting your review you must indicate whether or not you have any competing interests.</p>

 
<p>Occasionally, reviewers may be asked to offer their opinion on a manuscript that they may have reviewed for some other journal. This is not in itself a competing interest. That two journals have identified the same person as especially well qualified to judge the manuscript under consideration does not in any way decrease the validity of that opinion and may perhaps even enhance it.</p> 

<a name="feedback"></a>
<h2>12. Feedback to Reviewers</h2>

<p>We send reviewers' comments along with the decision letter to all reviewers of that manuscript. If reviewers have identified themselves, this information will be passed on to other reviewers. Reviewers who may have offered an opinion not in accordance with the final decision should not feel that their recommendation was not duly considered or their service not properly appreciated. Experts often disagree, and it is the job of the editorial team to make a final publication decision.</p>

<a name="sharing"></a>
<h2>13. Sharing reviews with other PLOS Journals</h2>

<p>PLOS publishes several journals. Occasionally, editors recommend after peer review that a particular article is more suitable for another PLOS journal. If the authors choose to pursue that option, we transfer the manuscript and the reviews to the other journal. We expect that reviewers for any PLOS journal are willing to have their reviews considered by the editors of another PLOS journal.</p>
