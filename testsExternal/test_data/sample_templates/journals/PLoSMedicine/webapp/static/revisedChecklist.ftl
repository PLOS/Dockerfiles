<h1>Checklist for Revised Manuscripts for <em>PLOS Medicine</em></h1>

<p><strong>Author Guidelines</strong> are available <a href="guidelines">here</a>.  <strong>Figure Guidelines</strong> are available <a href="figureGuidelines">here</a>.</p>

<p>Please follow these guidelines!</p>

<p>The following list highlights the most common problems with revised papers. </p>

<p><strong>1) For the response to reviewers, please ensure that:</strong></p>
 
<p>Your revisions address the specific points made by each reviewer. In your rebuttal letter you should list your responses to all the reviewers’ and editors’ comments and the changes you have made to the manuscript. Please upload this as a REBUTTAL LETTER file.</p>

<p>We also ask authors to provide a marked-up copy of the changes made from the previous article file as a SUPPORTING INFORMATION file.
</p>

<p><strong>2) In the text:</strong></p>
Structure of the paper:
<ul>
<li>The TITLE should be a clear description of the paper’s content. The design must be present for randomised controlled trials or systematic reviews or meta-analyses and should be included for other study types if useful.</li>
<li>The ABSTRACT should be divided into the following three sections with these headings: Background, Methods and Findings, and Conclusions. It should contain the all following elements, except for items in square brackets, which are only needed for some study types. Please use the same format for abstracts submitted as presubmission inquiries.</li>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Background</strong> section should describe clearly the rationale for the study being done. It should end with a statement of the specific study hypothesis and/or study objectives.</li>
<li>In <strong>Methods and Findings</strong>, describe the participants or what was studied (e.g. cell lines, patient group; be as specific as possible, including numbers studied). Describe the study design/intervention/main methods used/what was primarily being assessed, e.g. primary outcome measure and, if appropriate, over what period.<br /> 
[If appropriate, include how many participants were assessed out of those enrolled, e.g. what was the response rate for a survey]<br /> 
[If critical to the understanding of the paper, describe how results were analysed, i.e. which specific statistical tests were used] <br />
For the main outcomes provide a numerical result if appropriate (it nearly always is) and a measure of its precision (e.g. 95% confidence interval).<br />
Describe any adverse events or side effects.<br /> 
Describe the main limitations of the study.</li>
<li>In <strong>Conclusions</strong>, provide a general interpretation of the results with any important recommendations for future research.</li>
</ul>
<li>The end of the INTRODUCTION should include a brief statement of the intention of the paper (e.g. "We aimed to investigate the association of x with y"). Results should not be included here.</li>
<li>Your DISCUSSION should start with a brief summary of your main findings. The discussion must include a section assessing the limitations of the study.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Other common issues:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Use SI values throughout where applicable.</li>
<li>If you are reporting p values they should be exact unless below 0.001. P values should never be reported in isolation but must be accompanied by the figures from which they are derived, along with a measure of error (e.g. mean and SD, or 95% CIs).</li>
<li>If you report relative risks, you must also report the associated absolute risk.</li>
<li>In the relevant box of the submission form, you must declare all funding sources and state what their role was in the paper. Our standard phrase is: "The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript." If this statement is not correct you must amend as needed.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3) Please also ensure that the following production issues are complied with:</strong></p>
<ul>

<li>Article files should be submitted in DOC or RTF format. For technical reasons PLOS cannot accept Word 2007 DOCX files. If you created your manuscript using Word 2007, you must save the document as a Word 2003 file before submission. Please see the <a href="guidelines#preparation">Author Guidelines</a> for more details. Instructions for converting LaTeX files into Word or RTF format can be found here: <a href="latex">http://www.plosone.org/static/latex</a>.

</li>
<li>TABLES must be in an editable format (Word or Excel) and comply with the <a href="figureGuidelines" title="Figure Guidelines">Table Guidelines</a>. They should be included in the article file. In Word, all tables must be made using the table function with their structure given by table cells (i.e., no tabs, no returns, no spaces).
</li>
<li>FIGURES should be uploaded as individual files that comply with our <a href="figureGuidelines" title="PLOS Medicine | Figure and Table Guidelines">Figure Guidelines</a>. These figures must be TIF or EPS files.
</li>
<li>Please ensure that authors are entered in the correct order in the submission form and that the spellings of all names, institutions, and e-mail addresses are accurate. If any contributing authors have not replied to the previous e-mail sent requesting their contributions and competing interests, they must do so now. We don’t make final decisions regarding publication until all of these statements have been received.
</li>
<li>You must indicate your agreement to PLOS open access license in the URL (if this included within the decision letter).</li>
<li>Should your paper be accepted for publication, we may highlight it on our homepage with a suitable striking image. Please feel free to suggest a suitable image from the paper or another source. If your paper is accepted and the image is judged to be suitable by the editors, it may be featured on the <a href="http://www.plosmedicine.org">homepage</a>. It is <em>PLOS Medicine</em> policy not to use images of identifiable patients without their written consent. Please inform us of the source of the image if you provide one - anything we publish must be available under our open access <a href="license">license</a> or in the public domain.

</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any questions or require any assistance, in the first instance please contact <strong>PLOSMedicine [at] plos.org</strong> rather than the editor.</p>
