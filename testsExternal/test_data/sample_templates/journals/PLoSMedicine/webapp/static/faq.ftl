<h2>Open access and medical research</h2>

<h3>What is open-access publishing?</h3>

${open_access}


<p>Open access makes papers more useful by allowing sophisticated searching, manipulation, and mining of the
  literature.</p>

<h3>Why is open-access important for medical research?</h3>

<p>Published discoveries and ideas are the foundation for future progress in medicine and healthcare. The more widely
  and freely accessible they are, the greater their value to researchers, clinicians, policymakers, and the public.
  Unfettered access to this research literature will facilitate basic and clinical research throughout the world, and
  hasten the development of new treatments for those most in need.</p>

<h3>How will open-access publishing affect the practice of medical science?</h3>

<p>According to the World Health Organization, only 10% of health research funding targets the diseases and conditions
  that account for 90% of global health problems. Even worse, the research results that do address these problems remain
  inaccessible to the great majority of health care providers who need it most. Open-access publishing strives to
  correct this fundamental inequity by making medical research a global public resource, and by delivering critical
  information such that it may be easily condensed, summarized, and reproduced to support local health care efforts
  around the world. Closing the information gap between rich and poor nations provides a necessary first step towards
  promoting universal, evidence-based health care, while at the same time promoting scientific inquiry through the
  untrammeled exchange of ideas.</p>

<h3>Why do we need open access when other journals release their content within a year after publication?</h3>

<p>Not many journals release their content for free, and those that do maintain restrictions on how that free content
  may be used and distributed by readers. Furthermore, the delay they impose—often 6 or 12 months—can be problematic for
  both authors and readers of medical research. Open-access publishing offers a meaningful alternative: immediate access
  to the latest research, free of charge and with few limits on how the material is reused. We believe that medical
  research can and should be disseminated as efficiently, effectively, and equitably as possible.</p>

<h3>Do authors have to assign copyright to PLOS?</h3>

<p>No. It will be up to the authors to decide whether they wish to retain copyright or transfer copyright to their
  research institution or to PLOS. But no matter who owns the copyright, authors will be required to grant users an
  irrevocable license to print, copy, or use the work in any lawful way, subject to the condition that proper
  attribution is given whenever the work is reproduced or redistributed. Please see our
  <a href="/static/license">licensing agreement</a> for more information and
  <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0020025">this editorial</a> for a further explanation of why we
  employ this copyright arrangement.</p>

<h2>Inside <em>PLOS Medicine</em></h2>

<p><em>PLOS Medicine</em> publishes articles relevant to clinicians, policymakers, and researchers across a range of settings that address the major biological, 
environmental, social, and political determinants of health. The editors make decisions on submissions based upon their potential to directly and substantially 
inform clinical practice or health policy, and their relevance to our international audience.</p> 
<p>Articles given highest priority for publication are those that address conditions or risk factors that cause the greatest losses in years of healthy life and quality 
of life worldwide.</p>
<p><em>PLOS Medicine</em> also seeks to publish articles in the area of translational medicine that provide substantial, novel mechanistic insights into disease processes, 
with potential implications for clinical care. Additionally <em>PLOS Medicine</em> considers articles on topics relating to the integrity and ethics of the research enterprise; 
the practice of medicine; and the application of research to practice to fall within its scope.</p>



<h3>How is <em>PLOS Medicine</em> different from other high-profile, medical journals?</h3>

<p><em>PLOS Medicine</em> is the leading open-access medical
  journal, providing an innovative and influential venue for
  research and comment on the major challenges to human health
  worldwide. We specifically seek to publish papers which have
  relevance across a range of settings and that address the major
  environmental, social, and political determinants of health, as
  well as the biological.</p>

<p>By offering free access and redistribution rights for all our
  articles, <em>PLOS Medicine</em> aims to bring the latest medical
  research to a global audience. Our unique and rigorous review
  process is run as a collaborative effort between an international
  team of academic editors, who are experts in their field, and
  experienced, full-time professional editors working to ensure
  fairness and consistency. The journal is international and
  inclusive, covering global health issues, neglected diseases,
  health policy, and vital debates in medicine, with easy-to-read,
  professionally written Editors' Summaries provided for each
  research article. Finally, unlike most other medical journals,
  <em>PLOS Medicine</em> does not carry advertisements for drugs or
  other medical devices.</p>

<p><strong>Clinical researchers</strong>, <strong>practicing health care providers</strong>,
  <strong>policy-makers</strong>, <strong>medical educators</strong>, and <strong>medical students</strong>, as well as
  <strong>patients</strong>, <strong>their families</strong>, and <strong>their friends</strong>, will all benefit in
  different ways from reading <em>PLOS Medicine</em>.</p>

<h3>Why should clinical researchers read <em>PLOS Medicine</em>?</h3>

<p>As a top-tier medical journal, <em>PLOS Medicine</em>
  publishes high quality research papers across all medical fields,
  including global health and epidemiology. The journal is run by a
  team of experienced medical editors. The peer review process is
  run in collaboration with academic researchers thus ensuring the
  quality of published articles. Because <em>PLOS Medicine</em> is
  an open-access journal, clinical researchers do not have to
  depend on their institutions having a subscription in order to
  read important research papers.</p>

<h3>Why should practicing health care providers read <em>PLOS Medicine</em>?</h3>

<p><em>PLOS Medicine</em> emphasizes both original research and the application of that research to clinical practice.
  The Perspectives section will describe wider implications of an important research study, the Learning Forum sections
  uses specific clinical cases to educate health care providers about specific clinical issues. The journal publishes
  original research in all medical fields—including those most important to health care providers around the world—and
  also provides summaries for non experts written by the editorial staff.</p>

<h3>Why should health policy-makers read <em>PLOS Medicine</em>?</h3>

<p>As one of the only major medical publications to provide immediate, free access to all its content, <em>PLOS
  Medicine</em> has a particular role in the dissemination of the policy and practice of health care around the world.
  Any policymaker with Internet access can download and distribute an article without any restrictions (all we ask is
  that articles are cited correctly). Original research is supported by plain language summaries, and perspective
  articles that discuss the wider relevance of these findings. Sections in the magazine section of the journal will
  highlight the efforts of policy-makers to improve clinical care for their constituencies, and offer a wealth of essays
  and ideas for how research may be translated into public health.</p>

<h3>Why should medical educators read <em>PLOS Medicine</em>?</h3>

<h3>How does <em>PLOS Medicine</em> serve those in developing nations?</h3>

<p>As an open-access, medical journal with a strong focus on
  global health, <em>PLOS Medicine</em> provides a resource for
  health care providers in developing nations. Our
  <a href= "http://www.plosmedicine.org/static/license">open-access license</a>
  allows policy makers to reproduce and redistribute
  the journal's content as they see fit, maximizing its local
  impact through creative reuse, and providing crucial information
  to practitioners on the front lines. A local official could
  distribute a copy of an important article to every health
  professional in the country without fees or special permission.
  Furthermore, many of the articles, features, forums, and debates
  we publish address the most pressing health problems in
  developing nations. In addition, since we offer a fee waiver if
  requested, there are no barriers to authors from developing
  nations, or anyone else who may not be able to afford publication
  charges, publishing with us. Editorial decisions are made only on
  the basis of merit, not ability to pay.</p>

<h3>How can I support PLOS and <em>PLOS Medicine</em>?</h3>

<p>We encourage scientists and physicians to consider submitting to <em>PLOS Medicine</em> manuscripts of the highest
  possible quality-either research papers or articles for the Magazine section of the journal. In addition to submitting
  your best work, we need advocates within the community:</p>
<ul>
  <li>tell your colleagues about <em>PLOS Medicine</em></li>
  <li>if you hear from colleagues about a great piece of research, suggest that they submit it to PLOS for publication
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://register.plos.org/ambra-registration/register.action">sign up</a> to receive alerts and updates
    from our organization
  </li>
  <li>if you are a member of a society, consider whether your society's journals would better serve the community if
    they were open access
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Above all else, PLOS is a community initiative, so if you have thoughts about how we're doing, or if there's a new
  project you think we should be working on, please let us know.</p>

<h2>Publishing your paper in <em>PLOS Medicine</em></h2>

<h3>How do papers get reviewed at <em>PLOS Medicine</em>?</h3>

<p>We involve the academic community in our peer review process as much as possible. After professional staff have
  determined that the paper falls within the scope of the journal, and is of a minimum acceptable quality, decisions on
  whether to send a paper out for in-depth review are made via a collaboration between experienced, professional editors
  who work full time at PLOS, and academic editors who are experts in their field. In this system, all papers within the
  scope of the journal—even those rejected without peer review—receive ample consideration. The academic editors remain
  involved at all levels of the review process, through the oversight of revisions to the final acceptance of a
  paper.</p>

<h3>What are the turnaround times for submissions to the journal?</h3>

<p>It is essential that authors submit a <a href="guidelines#presubmission" title="Author Guidelines">presubmission
  inquiry</a> before submitting a full paper. Presubmission inquiries allow authors to find out within 2 working days
  whether their paper is likely to be broadly suitable for <em>PLOS Medicine</em>. If a full submission is sent to peer
  review, authors can expect the decision and reviews within 6 weeks of submission. Since we are not constrained by page
  budgets, papers are published around 6 weeks from the date of final acceptance, or according to an expedited schedule
  when necessary. All phases of the process can be tracked via through our <a
      href="http://www.editorialmanager.com/pmedicine" title="Go to Submission System">submission system</a>.
</p>

<h3>Measures of Impact</h3>

<p>At PLOS, we believe that articles in all journals should be assessed on their own merits rather than on the basis of
  the journal in which they were published.  PLOS journals have therefore initiated a program to provide a growing set
  of measures and indicators of impact at the article level that will include citation metrics, usage statistics,
  blogosphere coverage, social bookmarks and expert assessment. The long-term vision is to bring the
  views and activities of entire communities to bear, using the wealth of opportunities offered online, to provide new,
  meaningful and efficient mechanisms for research assessment. For more information on article-level metrics see the
  <a href="https://www.plos.org/cms/node/478" title="Read PLOS blog">PLOS blog</a>.</p>

<h3>Will all PLOS articles be published in English?</h3>

<p>Our journals are published in English, but in the future we would like to be able to make our publications available
  in multiple languages. As a first step, we encourage authors to submit translations of their abstracts or even whole
  articles and these are published as supplementary information. Our license agreement, the Creative Commons Attribution
  License, also allows anyone to make and distribute translations, as long as they give credit to the original
  authors.</p>

<h3>How will <em>PLOS Medicine</em> articles be archived, and how safe are they?</h3>

<p><em>PLOS Medicine</em> articles are made freely available at our Web site as soon as they are published, and also
  deposited in <a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/">PubMed Central</a>. We are also working with various partners
  to establish similar archives around the world. In addition, our licensing agreement allows any third party&#8212;librarian,
  institution, or individual&#8212;to establish their own archive of PLOS articles. The long-term safety of any article
  depends on the ease with which it can be copied and redistributed in multiple locations, and open-access publishing
  ensures that archiving will be as simple and secure as possible.</p>

<h3>What is the journal's position on competing interests?</h3>

<p>Competing interests are a factor in the consideration of a submitted manuscript. All authors are contacted via e-mail
  during the submission process and asked to declare whether they have any financial, personal, or professional
  interests that could be construed to have influenced the reporting of the experimental data or conclusions in their
  paper. <a href="competing">See our policy for more general information on the policy of PLOS towards competing
    interests</a>. Reviewers are also asked to declare any interests that might interfere with their objective
  assessment of a manuscript. Any relevant competing interests will be stated in the published article.</p>
