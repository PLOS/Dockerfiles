<h1>About <em>PLOS Medicine</em></h1>

<p><em>PLOS Medicine</em> is the leading open-access medical journal, providing an influential venue for outstanding research and commentary on the major challenges to 
human health worldwide. We specifically seek to publish articles relevant to clinicians and policymakers across a range of settings that adhere to the highest standards 
of methodology, ethics and reporting and address the major biological, environmental, social, and political determinants of health.</p> 
<p>All articles must be submitted first as presubmission inquiries. The median time from submission of a presubmission inquiry to a decision is 3 calendar days. <em>PLOS 
Medicine</em> is highly selective; for research articles, the number of accepted articles was 3% the number of presubmission inquiries for September 2011-2012. For 
manuscripts taken forward for in-depth consideration, <em>PLOS Medicine</em> applies rigorous editorial and peer review overseen by a team of professional editors and, 
in the case of research articles, an independent academic editor expert in the field.</p>
<p><em>PLOS Medicine</em> is committed to upholding the highest ethical standards in medical publishing, including the management and disclosure of 
<a href="http://www.plosmedicine.org/static/policies.action#competing">conflicts of interest in reporting, review, and publication</a>; transparency in the 
<a href="http://www.plosmedicine.org/static/reviewerGuidelines.action">review and publication process</a>; <a href="http://www.plosmedicine.org/static/policies.action#sharing">
data sharing</a> and reuse of work; authors' retention of <a href="http://www.plosmedicine.org/static/license.action">copyright</a>; open-access publication with no 
restrictions on availability and dissemination; and avoiding the <a href="http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.1000364">conflicts of 
interest presented by advertising for drugs and medical devices and exclusive sale of reprints</a>.

<h2>Scope</h2>

<p><em>PLOS Medicine</em> publishes articles relevant to clinicians, policymakers, and researchers across a range of settings that address the major biological, environmental, social, and political determinants of health. The editors make decisions on submissions based upon their potential to directly and substantially inform clinical practice or health policy, and their relevance to our international audience.</p> 
<p>Articles given highest priority for publication are those that address conditions or risk factors that cause the greatest losses in years of healthy life and quality of life worldwide.</p> 
<p><em>PLOS Medicine</em> also seeks to publish articles in the area of translational medicine that provide substantial, novel mechanistic insights into disease processes, with potential implications for clinical care. Additionally <em>PLOS Medicine</em> considers articles on topics relating to the integrity and ethics of the research enterprise; the practice of medicine; and the application of research to practice to fall within its scope.</p>




<h2>Measures of Impact</h2>

<p>At PLOS, we believe that articles in all journals should be assessed on their own merits rather than on the basis of
  the journal in which they were published. Â PLOS journals have therefore initiated a program to provide a growing set
  of measures and indicators of impact at the article level that will include citation metrics, usage statistics,
  blogosphere coverage, social bookmarks and expert assessment. The long-term vision is to bring the
  views and activities of entire communities to bear, using the wealth of opportunities offered online, to provide new,
  meaningful and efficient mechanisms for research assessment. For more information on article-level metrics see the
  <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2009/07/plos-journals-measuring-impact-where-it-matters/" title="Read PLOS blog">PLOS
    blog</a>.</p>
