<h1>2008 Competing Interests of the <em>PLOS Medicine</em> Editors</h1>

<p>PLOS is a tax-exempt, 501(c)3, nonprofit corporation that has received financial support in the form of grants from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, the Sandler Family Supporting Foundation, the Irving A. Hansen Memorial Foundation, the Open Society Institute, and the Joint Information Systems Committee. PLOS also receives financial support in the form of manuscript publication charges, donations, sponsorships (including from the pharmaceutical corporations Genentech and Merck), and memberships from private citizens, universities, and other organizations. The <em>PLOS Medicine</em> editors are paid a fixed salary (in particular, their salary is not linked to the number of papers published in the journal). More details about the funding of PLOS are <a href="http://www.plos.org/support/index.html">here</a>.</p>

<li><em>Reimbursement for attending a conference or symposium</em><br />
I gave two lectures at the annual meeting of the Latin American Federation of Medical Student Scientific Societies (FELSOCEM) in Panama in October 2005. FELSOCEM reimbursed the cost of my return flight from San Francisco to Panama City, and my accommodation and meals. I received no fee for delivering the lectures. In October 2006, I gave a talk about open access at the University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City-the university reimbursed PLOS for the flight, and it paid for my accommodation and meals. I donated the fee for my talk to PLOS. In February 2008, I am spending a week in the UK working with an editor from the Tropika.net project (<a href="http://www.tropika.net/">http://www.tropika.net/</a>), an online portal for tropical disease research and information, and my return flight is being paid for by TDR, the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases.  I am a Consulting Editor at PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases, which is a formal partner of TDR's Tropika.net project, which is why TDR is covering the cost of my flight.</li>
