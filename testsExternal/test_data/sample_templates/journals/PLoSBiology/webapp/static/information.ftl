<h2>Measures of Impact</h2>

<p>At PLOS, we believe that articles in all journals should be assessed on their own merits rather than on the basis of the journal in which they were published. Â PLOS journals have therefore initiated a program to provide a growing set of measures and indicators of impact at the article level that will include citation metrics, usage statistics, blogosphere coverage, social bookmarks and expert assessment. The long-term vision is to bring the views and activities of entire communities to bear, using the wealth of opportunities offered online, to provide new, meaningful and efficient mechanisms for research assessment. For more information on article-level metrics see the <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2009/07/plos-journals-measuring-impact-where-it-matters/" title="Read PLOS blog">PLOS blog</a>.</p>
