<a name="about"></a>
<h2>1. About <em>PLOS Biology</em></h2>

<p><em>PLOS Biology</em> is an open-access* journal published by the <a href="http://www.plos.org">PLOS</a>. The journal ${pbio_block}</p>

<p>* Open access means that every paper is freely available for everyone to read, download, copy, distribute and use.</p>


<a name="criteria"></a>
<h2>2. Criteria for Publication</h2>

<p><em>PLOS Biology</em> is highly selective in the manuscripts that it publishes; rejection rates are high. To be considered for publication in <em>PLOS Biology</em>, any given manuscript must be exceptional in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Originality</li>
<li>Importance to researchers in its field</li>
<li>Interest to scientists outside the field</li>
<li>Rigorous methodology and substantial evidence for its conclusions</li>
</ul>

<a name="presubmission"></a>
<h2>3. Presubmission Inquiries</h2>

<p>We strongly encourage authors to submit a presubmission
  inquiry before making a full submission. The purpose of a
  presubmission inquiry is to solicit rapid feedback from the staff
  editors about the potential suitability of a manuscript for the
  journal. </p>
  <p>Please see this <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/biologue/2012/06/28/whats-there-to-gain-from-a-well-explained-presubmission-enquiry/">PLOS Biologue article</a> by Chief Editor Theo Bloom for further guidelines.</p>
  <p><strong>Presubmission inquiries will be assessed for suitability
  in the context of the publishing mission of <em>PLOS
  Biology</em>: to publish exceptional research across all areas of
  the life sciences, with a particular emphasis on those areas for
  which unrestricted access is especially important to the research
  community or to the general public.</strong> Suitable papers will include
  substantial new conceptual or mechanistic insight, which
  significantly advance one or more particular fields, or will
  represent an application that is of fundamental importance to a
  field. If you wish to submit a presubmission inquiry, please log
  into the <em>PLOS Biology</em> online <a href=
  "http://www.editorialmanager.com/pbiology/">submission
  system</a> and select "Submit New Manuscript" from your
  homepage, and then choose the "Presubmission Inquiry" article type.</p>

  <p>Please note that a positive response from a staff editor is
  not a commitment to peer-review the article formally, but it is
  an expression of interest on the basis of the information you
  provide in the presubmission inquiry. The specific information we
  require is listed below. It is therefore in your interest to
  outline the importance of your claims, with reference to related
  work, and to describe the evidence you present in support of your
  conclusions as objectively as possible. Providing relevant
  information will save you time and help to ensure that the
  editors give you a response that is appropriate to the content of
  your article. Please also ensure that you check the remit of
  <a href="http://www.plos.org/journals/index.php">other PLOS
  journals</a> before submitting to <em>PLOS Biology</em>.</p>

  <p>To be of most use to authors and editors, presubmission
  inquiries should consist of the following:</p>

  <p><strong>A) A COVER LETTER</strong> of approximately 600 words that
  provides brief answers to the following questions:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>What is the scientific question you are addressing?</li>

    <li>What is the key finding that answers this question?</li>

    <li>What is the nature of the evidence you provide in support
    of your conclusion?</li>

    <li>What are the three most recently published papers that are
    relevant to this question?</li>

    <li>What significance do your results have for the field?</li>

    <li>What significance do your results have for the broader
    community (of biologists and/or the public)?</li>

    <li>What other novel findings do you present?</li>

    <li>Is there additional information that we should take into
    account?</li>
  </ol>

  <p>You may also include in the cover letter requests to exclude
  specific scientists from the evaluation process. Please provide a
  reason for doing so. Please also read <a href=
  "competing">our policy
  about competing interests</a> before submitting your inquiry.</p>

  <p><strong>B) A REFERENCED ABSTRACT</strong> <strong>of
  approximately 300 words</strong><strong>.</strong> For the
  purpose of the presubmission inquiry submission form, the
  referenced abstract will be your "article file" and should
  include up to 10 key references that put your work into context.
  <strong>Please do not submit your entire manuscript.</strong> The
  abstract should be structured as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>Background</em></strong><br>
   This section should describe clearly the
  rationale for the study being done and the previous work relevant
  to the study. It should end with a statement of the specific
  question or hypothesis being addressed.</p>

  <p><strong><em>Methodology/Principal Findings</em></strong><br>
   Mention the techniques
  used without going into extensive methodological detail, and
  outline the most important results. Include sample sizes for key
  experiments as appropriate. Please also outline any limitations
  of the study that may have a bearing on the results.</p>

  <p><strong><em>Conclusions/Significance</em></strong><br>
   Provide the take-home
  message of your article as clearly as possible. You may also
  include a brief, more general interpretation of the results and /
  or specific recommendations for future research. Please note,
  however, that the editors will pay most attention to the direct
  conclusions of the work being presented, rather than some
  possible future avenues being opened.</p>
</blockquote>
  <p><strong>C) YOUR CONTACT INFORMATION.</strong> Even though the form allows you
  to enter information for all authors who contributed to the
  manuscript, <strong>you need only enter information for the
  corresponding author.</strong></p>


  <p>If you have any questions or require assistance with the
  presubmission inquiry process, please e-mail
  <strong>plosbiology[at]plos.org.</strong></p>

  <p>Authors who receive an invitation to submit their full
  manuscripts will then enter the regular editorial process.</p>



<a name="overview"></a>
<h2>4. Overview of the Editorial Process</h2>

<p>Our aim is to provide all authors with an efficient, courteous, and constructive editorial process. To ensure the fairest and most objective decision-making, the editorial process is run as a partnership between the <em>PLOS Biology</em> <a href="http://www.plos.org/about/people/biology.html">professional editors</a> and the <a href="http://www.plosbiology.org/static/edboard">Editorial Board</a>, which is comprised of leaders in all fields of biology.</p>
<p>The ultimate responsibility for the <em>PLOS Biology</em> content and editorial decision-making lies with the team of professional editors.</p>

<p>On checking the status of a manuscript in our submission system, one of several status descriptions will appear. These correspond to the steps in the editorial process as follows:</p>
<h4>1) Status descriptions With Editor or Editor Invited</h4>
<p>Submitted manuscripts will be assigned to one of the professional editors, who will, in consultation with colleagues as appropriate, aim to make an initial evaluation of the paper within a maximum of 7 working days. If the editors feel the manuscript has the potential to fit within the scope of our journal , they will seek advice from an external Academic Editor, who is usually a member of the <a href="http://www.plosbiology.org/static/edboard">Editorial Board</a>, and decide if the work is likely to meet the requirement of providing a major advance in its field and describing a sufficient body of work to support the main claims. Since Academic Editors are busy working scientists, and from time to time the opinion of experts not on the Board has to be sought, there is a possibility of some delay at this stage; however, we do try to avoid this where we can and ensure that appropriate expert advice is secured as promptly as possible.</p>
<p>Academic Editors retain anonymity unless a paper is accepted for publication. The name of the Academic Editor is noted on each published paper.</p>

<h4>2) Under Review</h4>
<p>If the Academic Editor and professional editors agree that the paper meets the standards to justify review at <em>PLOS Biology</em>, it will be sent out for more detailed peer review. Should your paper be sent for review, you will be informed of this by email.</p>

<p>Expert reviewers will be asked to assess the technical and scientific merits of the work. We ask that review comments be returned within 10 days; however, this is not always possible for all reviewers, and in the interests of securing the best expert advice we do grant extensions where necessary. However, we also actively chase review comments when overdue to ensure that this requirement is balanced with that of fairness to authors.</p>

<h4>3) Required Reviews Complete</h4>
<p>Once all reviews of a manuscript have been received, the manuscript returns to the professional editors, who evaluate and consider the reviews. In some cases they may consult the Academic Editor for their opinion on the reviews prior to drafting a decision; in all cases, expert input from the Academic Editor is then sought on the drafted decision letter before finalizing it and sending it to the authors. Although we endeavor to make all decisions promptly, there may be some to-and-fro between editors, and it may be necessary to clarify issues with reviewers, before a final decision is made.</p>
<h4>4) Status is Accept, Reject or Revise</h4>
<p>This status description appears where a decision on the manuscript has been finalized and sent. If you see this status description on your manuscript but have not received a decision, please email <strong>plosbiology [at] plos.org</strong>.</p>


<p>There are several types of decisions possible: accept the paper as submitted; accept it with revision; invite the authors to revise the manuscript prior to the final decision; reject the manuscript, but with encouragement to resubmit it after extensive revision; or reject the manuscript outright, typically because it does not meet the criteria outlined above of originality, importance to the field, cross-disciplinary interest, or sound methodology. If the decision is to allow resubmission, the author will be advised in the decision letter whether the paper is likely to require further peer review at that time. The revised manuscript in all cases will be assessed by a professional editor and Academic Editor. Sometimes, re-review will be required, but in general we aim to make decisions without involving multiple rounds of review.</p>
<p>Upon acceptance, the manuscript enters our production system. Articles are typically published online within 6 weeks of formal acceptance, and usually before they are assembled into a complete monthly issue.
</p>
<h3>Appeals of Decisions</h3>
<p>If you wish to appeal a decision, you should contact the professional editor who handled the presubmission inquiry or full manuscript, explaining in detail your reasons for the appeal. Appeals will only be considered when a reviewer or editor is thought to have made a significant factual error or when his/her objectivity is compromised by a documented competing interest, and when a reversal based on either of these grounds would change the original decision.</p>
<p>All appeals will be discussed with at least one other professional editor; if those editors do not agree the appeal will be discussed at a full editorial meeting. Priority is given to new submissions to the journal, and the processing of appeals will usually take longer than the original submission. We hope, however, that this will not take longer than two weeks. While under appeal, a manuscript remains under formal consideration at <em>PLOS Biology</em> and hence should not be submitted for consideration elsewhere. We may or may not seek external advice on appeals, and we do not consider second appeals. </p>

 


<a name="preparation"></a>
<h2>5. Preparation of Research Manuscripts</h2>

<p><em>PLOS Biology</em> publishes original research articles of outstanding scientific significance. We will consider manuscripts of any length; we encourage the submission of both substantial full-length bodies of work and shorter manuscripts that report novel findings that might be based on a more limited range of experiments. The key criteria are that the work clearly demonstrates its novelty, its importance to a particular field as well as its interest to those outside that discipline, and conclusions that are justified by the study.</p>
 
<p>The writing style should be concise and accessible. Editors will make suggestions for how to achieve this, as well as suggestions for cuts or additions that could be made to the article to strengthen the argument. Our aim is to make the editorial process rigorous and consistent, but not intrusive or overbearing. Authors are encouraged to use their own voice and to decide how best to present their ideas, results, and conclusions.</p>

<p>Although we encourage submissions from around the globe, we require that manuscripts be submitted in English. As a step towards overcoming language barriers, we encourage authors fluent in other languages to provide copies of their full articles or abstracts in other languages. Translations should be submitted as supporting information and listed, together with other supporting information files, at the end of the article text.</p>

<a name="articlefile"></a>
<h3>Article File</h3>

<p>Articles can be submitted for review in DOC, DOCX, RTF, or PDF. Any articles that have been prepared in LaTeX will be accepted for review, but only in PDF format. After acceptance, only text files (RTF or DOC, LaTeX) of the revised manuscript and tables can be accepted for use in the production process. Please see our <a href="http://www.plosbiology.org/static/latexGuidelines">LaTeX guidelines</a> for further information on LaTeX file requirements at acceptance. </p>

<h4>Math Equations and DOCX</h4>

<p>If your manuscript is or will be in DOCX and contains equations, you must follow the instructions below to make sure that your equations are editable when the file enters production.</p>
<p>If you have not yet composed your article, you can ensure that the equations in your DOCX file remain editable in DOC by enabling &ldquo;Compatibility Mode&rdquo; before you begin. To do this, open a new document and save as Word 97-2003 (*.doc). Several features of Word 2007/10 will now be inactive, including the built-in equation editing tool. You can insert equations in one of the two ways listed below.</p>
<p>If you have already composed your article as DOCX and used its built-in equation editing tool, your equations will become images when the file is saved down to DOC. To resolve this problem, re-key your equations in one of the two following ways.</p>
</p>
<ol>
<li>Use MathType to create the equation. MathType is the recommended method for creating equations.</li>
<li>Go to Insert &gt; Object &gt; Microsoft Equation 3.0 and create the equation.</li>
</ol>
<p>If, when saving your final document, you see a message saying &ldquo;Equations will be converted to images,&rdquo; your equations are no longer editable and PLOS will not be able to accept your file.</p>




<h3>Organization of the Manuscript</h3>

<p>Most articles published in <em>PLOS Biology</em> will be organized into the following sections: Title, authors, affiliations, abstract, introduction, results, discussion, materials and methods, references, acknowledgments, and figure legends.  Uniformity in format will facilitate the experience of readers and users of the journal.  Page numbers are required for all sections (figures exempted).  There are no specific length restrictions for the overall manuscript or individual sections. However, we urge authors to present and discuss their findings concisely.   We recognize that some works will not be best presented in our research article format.  If you have a manuscript that would benefit from a different format, please contact the editors to discuss this further.</p>

<p>Our submission system can support a large range of formats for text and graphics, but if you experience difficulties with the site or are concerned about the suitability of your files, please contact the editorial department <strong>plosbiology [at] plos.org</strong>.</p>

<p>
Please submit your manuscript with double spacing (a blank line under each line of text) for the convenience of the editors and any reviewers.</p>

<h3>Title (150 characters, including spaces)</h3>

<p>The title should be specific to the project yet concise. It should be comprehensible to readers outside your field. Avoid specialist abbreviations, if possible. Titles should be presented in title case, meaning that all words except for prepositions, articles, and conjunctions should be capitalized.</p>

<p>Example:<br />
Detection of Specific Sequences among DNA Fragments Separated by Gel Electrophoresis.</p>

<p>Please also provide a brief "running head" of approximately 50 characters. If your article is published, this will appear as a heading on each page of the paper.
</p>

<h3>Authors and Affiliations</h3>

<p>PLOS journals follow the <a href=
  "http://publicationethics.org/">COPE guidelines</a> covering
  changes in authorship. Please note that if any changes to the
  list of authors of a manuscript are necessary after the initial
  submission of a manuscript to a PLOS journal but before its
  publication, the corresponding author must first contact the
  journal staff and provide a clear reason for the change(s). If
  the change to the authorship list is appropriate and in keeping
  with the guidelines above, the corresponding author will be asked
  to provide written confirmation that all other authors listed on
  the manuscript at that time consent to the change(s). Any
  individuals who the corresponding author requests to add or
  remove from the list of authors will be contacted.</p>

<p>Provide the first names or initials (if used), middle names or initials (if used), surnames, and affiliations &mdash; department, university or organization, city, state/province (if applicable), and country &mdash; for all authors. The information entered into our online system must be correct, as it will be published for accepted papers. If you require assistance in correcting author affiliations, etc. please contact our editorial team at <strong>plosbiology [at] plos.org</strong>.</p>

<p>One author should be designated as the corresponding author. It is the corresponding author's responsibility to ensure that the author list, and the summary of the author contributions to the study are accurate and complete. If the article has been submitted on behalf of a consortium, all consortium members and affiliations should be listed after the Acknowledgments.
</p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>The abstract succinctly introduces the paper. It should mention the techniques used without going into methodological detail and mention the most important results. The abstract is conceptually divided into the following three sections: Background, Methodology/Principal Findings, and Conclusions/Significance. However, the abstract should be written as a single paragraph without these headers. Please do not include any citations in the abstract. Avoid specialist abbreviations. Please note that the Abstract and Author Summary are not required for article types other than research articles; see our <a href="guidelines#other">guidelines for other article types</a>.</p>
 
<h3>Author Summary</h3>

<p>We ask that authors submitting revised manuscripts include a 150-200 word non-technical summary of the work as a separate file, uploaded as a Related Manuscript File, with the title "Author Summary". Subject to editorial review, this short text is published with all research articles as a highlighted text box. The Author Summary is not needed for article types other than research articles, primers, and select front matter articles. </p>

<p>Distinct from the scientific abstract, the author summary is included in the article to make findings accessible to an audience of both scientists and non-scientists. Ideally aimed to a level of understanding of an undergraduate student, the significance of the work should be presented simply, objectively, and without exaggeration.</p>

<p>
Authors should avoid the use of acronyms and complex scientific terms and write the text using a first person voice. Authors may benefit from consulting with a science writer or press officer to ensure they effectively communicate their findings to a general audience. We encourage you to look at two examples of summaries currently online in PLOS Biology. These examples should help you determine the level we are aiming for:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.0050009#abstract2" title="Read Article: Synopsis section">Example 1</a></li>
<li><a href="/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.0050006#abstract2" title="Read Article: Synopsis section">Example 2</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Blurb</h3>

<p>In addition to the Author Summary, we require a brief statement ("blurb") about the work. The blurbs will be included in our weekly and monthly Electronic Table of Contents, sent out to users signed up to receive alerts from <em>PLOS Biology</em>. The blurb should be about 20 to 30 words long and is subject to editorial changes. It should, without exaggeration, entice people to read your manuscript. It should not be redundant with the title and should not contain acronyms or abbreviations. The following examples should help you determine the style we are looking for: </p>

<ul>
<li>During embryonic development of the motor system of <em>Drosophila</em>, motorneurons target their dendrites to different regions along the body axis in response to midline guidance cues.</li>
<li>A neuroimaging study reveals novel insights into how the brain responds to an anticipated event, such as a starting gun or responding to a green light.</li>
<li>Computational modeling and experimentation in a model system for actin-based force generation explain how actin networks initiate and maintain directional movement.</li>
</ul>

<p>For further examples, please view the blurbs accompanying the articles on the homepage of <em>PLOS Biology</em>.</p>

<p>Please submit your Blurb as a sentence or two, at the bottom of the document containing your Author Summary, under the heading "Blurb."</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>The introduction should put the focus of the manuscript into a broader context. As you compose the introduction, think of readers who are not experts in this field. Include a brief review of the key literature. If there are relevant controversies or disagreements in the field, they should be mentioned so that a non-expert reader can delve into these issues further. The introduction should conclude with a brief statement of the overall aim of the experiments and a comment about whether that aim was achieved.</p>
 
<h3>Results</h3>

<p>The results section should provide details of all of the experiments that are required to support the conclusions of the paper. There is no specific word limit for this section, but details of experiments that are peripheral to the main thrust of the article and that detract from the focus of the article should not be included. The section may be divided into subsections, each with a concise subheading. Large datasets, including raw data, should be submitted as supplemental files; these are published online alongside the accepted article. The results section should be written in past tense.</p>
 
<h3>Discussion</h3>

<p>The discussion should spell out the major conclusions and interpretations of the work including some explanation on the significance of these conclusions. How do the conclusions affect the existing assumptions and models in the field? How can future research build on these observations? What are the key experiments that must be done? The discussion should be concise and tightly argued.  If warranted, the results and discussion may be combined into one section.</p>
 
<h3>Materials and Methods</h3>

<p>This section should provide enough detail for reproduction of the findings. Protocols for new methods should be included, but well-established protocols may simply be referenced. We encourage authors to submit, as separate files, detailed protocols for newer or less well-established methods. These will be published online linked to the article and will be fully searchable.</p>
 
<h3>Acknowledgments</h3>
<p>People who contributed to the work, but do not fit the criteria for authors should be listed in the Acknowledgments, along with their contributions. You must also ensure that anyone named in the acknowledgments agrees to being so named. The Acknowledgments section is reserved for statements of gratitude or thanks. Details of the funding sources that have supported the work should be confined to the funding statement. Do not include them in the Acknowledgments.
</p>


 
<h3>References</h3>
${references} 

<a name="financialdisclosure" id="financialdisclosure"></a>
<h3>Financial Disclosure</h3>
<p>This section should describe sources of funding that have supported the work. Please include relevant grant numbers and the URL of any funder's Web site. Please also include this sentence: "The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript." If this statement is not correct, you must describe the role of any sponsors or funders, and amend the aforementioned sentence as needed.</p>

<h2>7. Other Article Types</h2>

<p>While remaining scientifically rigorous, the magazine section of <em>PLOS Biology</em> is inclusive and accessible to a broad audience. All articles submitted to the magazine section should be directed at a readership that extends beyond the traditional research community and that includes scientific educators, students, physicians, patients, and the interested public. Most articles in the magazine section are peer reviewed.</p>

<p>The majority of articles in the magazine section of <em>PLOS Biology</em> are published by invitation only, but if you have a suggestion for a topic in any of the following categories, we will consider the idea. Please submit your suggestions for front matter via our online submission system as a presubmission inquiry. There is no publication fee for front matter articles.</p>

<p>For these article types, you do not need to include an Abstract or an Author Summary unless otherwise requested by an editor. You may find that some of the fields on the submission form are not appropriate to your front matter article&mdash;please enter a full stop/period in these boxes. If you have any questions about this process, please contact our publication assistants at <strong>plosbiology [at] plos.org</strong>.</p>

<h3>Essays</h3>

<p><em>PLOS Biology</em> publishes visionary and provocative essays that cover broad topics of general interest to life scientists. Essays might explore the implications of recent advances in a given field or global methods that promise to have broad-ranging consequences across fields, investigate an emerging trend with cross-disciplinary implications, or explain the challenges of a nascent field.</p>

<h3>Challenges Series</h3>

<p>The Challenges Series, which appears periodically in the Essays section, features short articles highlighting fundamental challenges that cut across and help unify different sub-disciplines in biology. The series editor is Simon Levin.</p>

<h3>Unsolved Mysteries</h3>

<p>Unsolved Mysteries discuss a topic of biological importance that is poorly understood and in need of research attention, and may explore issues that have been ignored, pose technically and conceptually challenging questions, or involve puzzling phenomena with potentially devastating consequences.

<h2>8. Outline of the Production Process</h2>

<p>Once an article has been accepted for publication, the manuscript files are transferred into our production system. Manuscripts are then copyedited by professional copyeditors who correspond directly with the authors concerning queries and corrections. Once the article has been typeset, PDF proofs are generated so that authors can approve the final article. The prompt return of proofs by authors will expedite the production process. PLOS permits only the following types of corrections to the PDF proofs: errors in author names or affiliations, errors to scientific fact that would cause misunderstandings to readers, and printer's (introduced) errors. Other correction requests will not be fulfilled. Therefore it is CRITICAL that you check your article Word file, the figures, and the tables very carefully when you see the copyedited article. Requests for corrections to any of these items may be denied once the article is in proofs.

<h2>9. Reader Responses and Notes, Comments and Ratings</h2>

<p>On the 28<sup>th</sup> March 2009, the Reader Response functionality on <em>PLOS Biology</em> articles was discontinued in preparation for our launch on a new publishing platform that features a number of 'Web 2.0' tools to facilitate community evaluation and discourse around published articles.</p>
<p>All the Reader Response contributions that were in our archive are now available as comments directly added to the relevant article.</p>
<p>To contribute to an existing discussion about an article or to start a new one, see the <a href="commentGuidelines" title="Comment Guidelines">guidelines explaining how you can add Notes, Comments and Ratings</a> to any <em>PLOS Biology</em> article.</p>
