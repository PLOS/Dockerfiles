<h1>Image manipulation &mdash; some general guidance</h1>
<p>Image files should not be manipulated or adjusted in any way that could lead to misinterpretation of the information present in the original image. <b>Our policy and figure manipulation checking procedures can be found <a href="http://www.plosbiology.org/static/figureGuidelines.action#manipulation">here</a>.  We routinely check figures for one in four accepted articles.</b> Should your manuscript be selected for routine figure checking, we will require you to supply us with your original photographic images in the original file format and at the resolution at which they were first created.</p>
<p>We realise that the extent to which figures can be changed as part of normal preparation can pose dilemmas, so have provided some general guidance below on aspects to consider when preparing your figures.  For further information, image examples and more detailed guidance we advise reading <a href="http://jcb.rupress.org/content/166/1/11.full">&apos;What&apos;s in a picture? The temptation of image manipulation&apos;</a> (reprinted in the Journal of Cell Biology, JCB vol. 166 no. 1 11-15).</p>
<p>Here are some general issues to watch out for, with links to image examples of each below.</p>
<p><b>Please watch out for these common issues which all count as unacceptable figure manipulation:</b></p>
<ul><li>The introduction, enhancement, movement, or removal of specific feature(s) within an image;<ul><li>For examples, see Figures 1 and 5 of <a href="http://jcb.rupress.org/content/166/1/11.figures-only">&apos;What&apos;s in a picture? The temptation of image manipulation&apos;</a>;</li></ul>
</li><li>
Unmarked grouping of images that should otherwise have been presented separately (for example, from different parts of the same gel, or from different gels, fields, or exposures);<ul><li>For an example, see Figure 6 of <a href="http://jcb.rupress.org/content/166/1/11.figures-only">&apos;What&apos;s in a picture? The temptation of image manipulation&apos;</a>;</li></ul></li>
<li>Adjustments of brightness, contrast, or colour balance that obscure, eliminate, or misrepresent any information;<ul><li>For an example, see Figure 3 of <a href="http://jcb.rupress.org/content/166/1/11.figures-only">&apos;What&apos;s in a picture? The temptation of image manipulation&apos;</a>;</li></ul></li></ul>           

                 
               

<p><b>Poor quality images are also likely to raise possible figure manipulation queries and/or requests to remake figures</b></p>

              
           


<ul><li>Please ensure that your images have a resolution (number of pixels per unit area) of at least 300 dots per inch (dpi) and appear sharp, not pixelated. Poor quality images cannot be checked.</li><br/>
<li>Be careful not to inadvertently reduce the resolution when creating a file in Photoshop (or similar). When opening your image file in Photoshop, you have the option of setting the size and resolution of the image.<b>Do not set the total number of pixels to be greater than that in the original image (from the digital camera attached to your microscope) while keeping the image size the same;</b> otherwise, the computer must create data for you that were not present in the original, and the resulting image is a misrepresentation of the original data. The dpi can only be increased if the image size is reduced proportionately.</li><br/>
<li>Spliced gels need a thin dividing line added to indicate the alteration. It is fine to remove a complete lane and splice the remaining lanes together, but the alternation must be indicated by a thin white or black line between the juxtaposed pieces.</li> <br/>
<li>Images must contain background noise rather than the background appearing as one uniform colour. Do not &apos;clean up&apos; the background of images with rubberstamp or &apos;wipe&apos; tools for reasons of beautification, or over adjust the brightness or contrast so that the background is removed. 
<ul><li>For an example, see Figure 4 of <a href="http://jcb.rupress.org/content/166/1/11.figures-only">&apos;What&apos;s in a picture? The temptation of image manipulation&apos;</a>;</li></ul></li></ul>
