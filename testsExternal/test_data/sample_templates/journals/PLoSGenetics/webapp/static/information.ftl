<h2>Scope</h2>

<p>Genetics and genomics research has grown at a bewildering pace in the past 15 years. The techniques of these fields are being applied to a wealth of biological questions and experimental systems. <em>PLOS Genetics</em> reflects the full breadth and interdisciplinary nature of this research by publishing outstanding original contributions in all areas of biology.</p>
 
<p><em>PLOS Genetics</em> publishes human studies, as well as research on model organisms&#8212;from mice and flies, to plants and bacteria. Our emphasis is on studies of broad interest that provide significant insight into a biological process or processes. Topics include (but are not limited to) gene discovery and function, population genetics, genome projects, comparative and functional genomics, medical genetics, disease biology, evolution, gene expression, complex traits, chromosome biology, and epigenetics.</p>

<h2>Measures of Impact</h2>

<p>At PLOS, we believe that articles in all journals should be assessed on their own merits rather than on the basis of the journal in which they were published. Â PLOS journals have therefore initiated a program to provide a growing set of measures and indicators of impact at the article level that will include citation metrics, usage statistics, blogosphere coverage, social bookmarks and expert assessment. The long-term vision is to bring the views and activities of entire communities to bear, using the wealth of opportunities offered online, to provide new, meaningful and efficient mechanisms for research assessment. For more information on article-level metrics see the <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2009/07/plos-journals-measuring-impact-where-it-matters/" title="Read PLOS blog">PLOS blog</a>.</p>
