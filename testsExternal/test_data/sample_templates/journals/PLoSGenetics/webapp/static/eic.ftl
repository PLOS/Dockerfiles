<h2>Biography for Gregory S. Barsh</h2>

  <p>Greg Barsh is an Investigator at the HudsonAlpha Institute for
  Biotechnology and a Professor of Genetics at Stanford
  University School of Medicine. He has a longstanding interest in
  applying the genetics of color variation in laboratory mice to
  basic questions in gene regulation and cell signaling, and is
  currently studying the biology and genetic architecture of colors
  and color patterns in non-model mammalian organisms, including
  humans.</p>

  <p>Greg obtained his BS in Biology from University of California
  Irvine in 1977 and then obtained a PhD in the Genetics of Human
  Disease and an MD in Medicine from the University of Washington
  in 1984. He has served as Program Director of the Medical
  Scientist Training Program and Associate Chair of the Department
  of Genetics at Stanford University, and as the Chair of the
  Genetics of Health and Disease Study Section. His research group
  has published several papers in PLOS family of journals.</p>

  <h2>Biography for Gregory P. Copenhaver</h2>

  <p>Greg Copenhaver shares joint appointments as an Associate
  Professor in the Department of Biology and the Carolina Center
  for Genome Sciences at The University of North Carolina at Chapel
  Hill. At a broad level Greg's research interests focus on
  chromosome dynamics. More specifically, his recent work has
  focused on two areas. First, understanding how multi-cellular
  eukaryotes regulate the frequency and distribution of meiotic
  recombination events. Second, determining how centromere
  structure relates to function and how that knowledge can be used
  to engineer mini-chromosomes as vehicles for gene delivery in
  plants.</p>

  <p>Greg obtained his BS in Botany from University of California
  Riverside in 1990 and then obtained a PhD in the Biology and
  Biomedical Sciences from Washington University in St. Louis in
  1996. He completed his postdoctoral studies in Genetics at The
  University of Chicago in 2001. He serves as the Director of
  Graduate Studies (Biology &#8211; MCDB) at UNC. In addition, he
  co-founded the biotechnology company Chromatin Inc. He has also published several papers in PLOS family of journals.</p>
