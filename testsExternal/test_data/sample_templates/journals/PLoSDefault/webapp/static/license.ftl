Under the CCAL, authors retain ownership of the copyright for their article, but authors allow anyone to download, reuse, reprint, modify, distribute, and/or copy articles in PLOS journals, so long as the original authors and source are cited. <strong>No permission is required from the authors or the publishers.</strong></p>

<p>In most cases, appropriate attribution can be provided by simply citing the original article (e.g., Kaltenbach LS et al.

If the item you plan to reuse is not part of a published article (e.g., a featured issue image), then please indicate the originator of the work, and the volume, issue, and date of the journal in which the item appeared.  For any reuse or redistribution of a work, you must also make clear the license terms under which the work was published.</p>
