<#assign publication_charges = '<p>To provide open access, PLOS journals use a business model in which our expenses&mdash;including those of peer review, journal production, and online hosting and archiving&mdash;are recovered in part by charging a publication fee to the authors or research sponsors for each article they publish. The <a href="http://www.plos.org/publish/pricing-policy/publication-fees/">fees</a> vary by journal.</p>

<p>PLOS is committed to the widest possible global participation in open access publishing. To determine the appropriate fee, we use a country-based pricing model, which is based on the country that provides 50% or more of the primary funding for the research that is being submitted. Research articles funded by Upper Middle and High Income Countries incur our <a href="http://www.plos.org/publish/pricing-policy/publication-fees/">standard publication fees</a>. Corresponding authors who are affiliated with one of our <a href="http://www.plos.org/support-us/institutional-membership/members-list/">Institutional Members</a> are eligible for a discount on this fee. Such authors will be informed of the discount applicable after submission of their manuscript.</p>

<p>Fees for Low and Lower Middle Income Countries are calculated according to the <a href="http://www.plos.org/about/viewpoints/global-participation-initiative/">PLOS Global Participation Initiative</a> pricing program for manuscripts submitted after 9am Pacific Time on September 4, 2012 (this program is not retroactive).

<#--  Reviewer Guidelines Blocks -->



<#assign reviewers_competing_interests = '<p>As far as possible we respect requests by authors to exclude reviewers whom they consider to be unsuitable. We also, as much as possible, try to rule out those reviewers who may have an obvious competing interest, such as those who may have been collaborators on other projects with the authors of the manuscript under review, those who may be direct competitors, those who may have a known history of antipathy with the author(s), or those who might profit financially from the work. Because it is not possible for all such competing interests to be known by a particular editor, we request that reviewers who recognize a potential competing interest inform the editors or journal staff and recuse themselves if they feel that are unable to offer an impartial review.</p>
 
<p><a href="competing" title="PLOS policy regarding competing interests">Click here for more general information on PLOS&apos;s policy regarding competing interests.</a> When submitting your review you must indicate whether or not you have any competing interests.</p>
 
<p>On occasion, reviewers may be asked to offer their opinion on a manuscript that they may have reviewed for some other journal. This is not in itself a competing interest. That two journals have identified the same person as especially well qualified to judge the manuscript under consideration does not in any way decrease the validity of that opinion and may perhaps even enhance it.</p>'>

<#assign feedback_reviewers = '<p>We send reviewers\' comments along with the decision letter to all reviewers of that manuscript. If reviewers have identified themselves, this information will be passed on to other reviewers. Reviewers who may have offered an opinion not in accordance with the final decision should not feel that their recommendation was not duly considered or their service not properly appreciated. Experts often disagree, and it is the job of the editorial team to make a final publication decision.</p>'>

<#assign sharing_reviews = '<p>PLOS publishes several journals. Occasionally, editors recommend after peer review that a particular article is more suitable for another PLOS journal. If the authors choose to pursue that option, we transfer the manuscript and the reviews to the other journal. We expect that reviewers for any PLOS journal are willing to have their reviews considered by the editors of another PLOS journal.</p>'>

<#--  Policies Blocks -->

<#assign copyright_policies = '<p>Upon submission of an article, authors are asked to indicate their agreement to abide by an open-access license. The license permits any user to download, print out, extract, archive, and distribute the article, so long as appropriate credit is given to the authors and source of the work. The license ensures that your article will be as widely available as possible and that your article can be included in any scientific archive.</p>

<p>Upon publication, PLOS also deposits all articles in <a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/" title="PubMed Central">PubMed Central</a>.  This complies with the policies of funding agencies, such as the <a href="http://publicaccess.nih.gov/" title="NIH">NIH</a> in the USA, the <a href="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/node3302.html" title="Wellcome Trust">Wellcome Trust</a> and the <a href="http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/access/" title="Research Councils in the UK">Research Councils</a> in the UK, and the <a href="http://www.dfg.de/en/news/information_science_research/other_news/info_wissenschaft_04_06.html" title="Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft">Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</a> in Germany, which request or require deposition of the published articles that they fund into publicly available databases.</p>

<#assign human_animal_research = '<p>All research involving human participants must have been approved by the authors\' institutional review board or equivalent committee(s) and that board must be named by the authors in the manuscript. For research involving human participants, informed consent must have been obtained (or the reason for lack of consent explained, e.g. the data were analyzed anonymously) and all clinical investigation must have been conducted according to the principles expressed in the <a href="http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/b3/index.html" title="Declaration of Helsinki"><em>Declaration of Helsinki</em></a>. Authors should be able to submit, upon request, a statement from the research ethics committee or institutional review board indicating approval of the research. We also encourage authors to submit a sample of a patient consent form, and may require submission on particular occasions.</p>

<p>For studies involving humans categorized by race/ethnicity, age, disease/disabilities, religion, sex/gender, sexual orientation, or other socially constructed groupings, authors should, as much as possible,</p>
<ul>
<li>make explicit their methods of categorizing human populations; </li>
<li>define categories in as much detail as the study protocol allows; </li>
<li>justify their choices of definitions and categories, including for example whether any rules of human categorization were required by their funding agency;</li>
<li>explain whether (and if so, how) they controlled for confounding variables such as socioeconomic status, nutrition, environmental exposures, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, outmoded terms and potentially stigmatizing labels should be changed to more current, acceptable terminology. Examples: &quot;Caucasian&quot; should be changed to &quot;white&quot; or &quot;of [Western] European descent&quot; (as appropriate); &quot;cancer victims&quot; should be changed to &quot;patients with cancer&quot;.</p>
<h3>Reporting of Animal Studies and Ethical Treatment of Animals</h3>
<p>For studies involving animals, all work must have been conducted according to relevant national and international guidelines.  Prior approval must have been obtained for all protocols from the author&apos;s institutional or other relevant ethics committee and the institution name and permit numbers provided at submission (see example below). For research involving non-human primates, all studies must be performed in accordance with the recommendations of the Weatherall report, &quot;<a href="http://www.acmedsci.ac.uk/images/project/nhpdownl.pdf">The use of non-human primates in research</a>&quot;. Where unregulated animals are used or ethics approval is not required by a specific committee, the article should include a clear statement of this and the reasons why ethical approval is not required.</p>
<p>We also strongly encourage all authors to comply with the &quot;Animal Research: Reporting <em>In Vivo</em> Experiments&quot; <a href="http://www.nc3rs.org.uk/ARRIVE">(ARRIVE) guidelines</a>, developed by <a href="http://www.nc3rs.org.uk/">NC3Rs</a> to improve standards of reporting to ensure that the data from animal experiments can be fully scrutinised and utilised. Relevant information should be included in the appropriate section of the article (e.g. title, abstract, or method) as outlined in the guidelines. Please note that these guidelines can be applied to any area of bioscience research using laboratory animals.</p>
<p>Example of statement of ethical approval: <em>This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The protocol was approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of the University of Minnesota (Permit Number: 27-2956).

We recommend, however, that authors not contact the media or respond to such contact unless an article has been accepted for publication and an embargo date has been established. Respect for press embargoes will help to ensure that your work is reported accurately in the popular media, and that the full peer-reviewed paper is freely available to any interested reader when the news item is published. If a journalist has covered a piece of work ahead of publication, this will not affect consideration of the work for publication.

<h5>Data Availability</h5>

<p>Open access applies to both the scientific literature and the data used to establish that literature. Publication is contingent on making data integral to a manuscript freely available without restriction, provided that appropriate attribution is given and that suitable mechanisms exist for sharing the data used in a manuscript.</p>

<ol>
<li>Data for which public repositories have been established that are in general use should be deposited before publication, and the appropriate accession numbers or digital object identifiers published with the paper.</li>
<li>If an appropriate repository does not exist, data should be provided as supporting information with the published paper. If this is not practical, data should be made freely available upon reasonable request.</li>
<li>The conclusions of a study must not be dependent solely on the analysis of proprietary data. If proprietary data were used to reach a conclusion, and the authors are unwilling or unable to make these data public, then the paper must include an analysis of public data that validates the conclusions so that others can reproduce the analysis and build on the findings.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that any restrictions on the availability or on the use of datasets might be judged to diminish the significance of a paper and will therefore influence the decision about whether a paper should be published. These policies have been developed in accordance with the principles established in <a href="http://www.nap.edu/books/0309088593/html/" title="Sharing Publication-Related Data and Materials (National Academies Press, 2003)"><em>Sharing Publication-Related Data and Materials</em></a> (National Academies Press, 2003).</p>

<h5>Software/Algorithm Sharing</h5>

  <p>If new software or a new algorithm represents a significant
  part of a journal article, the authors must provide sufficient
  information to allow interested users to reproduce and build on
  the authors\' work. <strong>This implies that wherever possible
  all relevant materials be freely available and preferably
  accessible through public archives, open source repositories and
  the like</strong>. Software can be provided under license where
  necessary, but any restrictions on the availability or on the use
  of materials will be judged to diminish the significance of a
  paper and therefore might influence the decision about whether a
  paper should be published subject to those conditions. These
  policies have been developed in accordance with the principles
  established in <a href="http://www.nap.edu/books/0309088593/html/" title="Sharing Publication-Related Data and Materials (National Academies Press, 2003)"><em>Sharing Publication-Related Data and Materials</em></a>

  any reporting guidelines that apply to your particular study
  design and ensure you include any required supporting information

<h5>a. Clinical Trials</h5> 
<p> We follow the WHO definition of a clinical trial. See <a href="http://www.who.int/ictrp/en/">http://www.who.int/ictrp/en/</a>.</p>
<p>&quot;A clinical trial is any research study that prospectively assigns human participants or groups of humans to one or more health-related interventions to evaluate the effects on health outcomes. Interventions include but are not restricted to drugs, cells and other biological products, surgical procedures, radiologic procedures, devices, behavioural treatments, process-of-care changes, preventive care, etc&quot;</p>
<p>PLOS supports the position of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) on trial registration. All trials initiated after 1 July 2005 must be registered prospectively in a publicly accessible registry (i.e., before patient recruitment has begun), or they will not be considered for publication. For trials initiated before 1 July 2005, all trials must be registered before submission to our journals. See the <a href="http://www.icmje.org/faq_clinical.html">ICMJE faq</a> on trial registration for further details. The WHO\'s list of approved registries is listed <a href="http://www.who.int/ictrp/network/primary/en/index.html">here</a>. The editors reserve the right to inform authorsâ€™ institutions or ethics committees about unregistered trials that have been carried out.</p>
 <p>Authors of trials must adhere to the CONSORT reporting guidelines appropriate to their trial design. Please check the <a href="http://www.consort-statement.org">CONSORT statement Web site</a> for information on the appropriate guidelines for specific trial types. Before the paper can enter peer review authors must: 1) name in the paper trial registry, trial registration number, and IRB and 2) provide a copy of the trial protocol and a completed CONSORT checklist as supporting files (these documents will also be published alongside the paper, if accepted). The CONSORT flow diagram must be included as Figure 1. Any deviation from the trial protocol must be explained in the paper. Authors must explicitly discuss informed consent in their paper, and PLOS reserves the right to ask for a copy of the patient consent form. Information on statistical methods or participants beyond what is indicated in the CONSORT statement should be reported in the Methods section.</p>
 <p>
PLOS supports the public disclosure of all clinical trial results, as mandated for example by the FDA Amendments Act, 2007. Prior disclosure of results on a public Web site such as clinicaltrials.gov will not affect the decision to peer review or acceptance of papers in PLOS journals.</p>

<!--Origin of text unclear -->
<!--<h3>Background</h3> 
<p>This section should describe clearly the rationale for the study being done. It  should end with a statement of the specific study hypothesis and/or study  objectives. </p>
<p>[For a clinical trial provide any trial identification numbers and names (e.g.  trial registration number, protocol number or acronym).] </p>

<h3>Methods and Findings</h3>

<ul>
<li>Describe the participants or what was studied (e.g. cell lines, patient group;  be as specific as possible, including numbers studied). </li>
<li> Describe the study design/intervention/main methods used. </li>
<li>  Describe what was primarily being assessed e.g. primary outcome measure and, if  appropriate, over what period. </li>
<li>  [If appropriate, include how many participants were assessed out of those  enrolled, e.g. what was the response rate for a survey.] </li>
 <li> [If critical to the understanding of the paper, describe how results were  analyzed, e.g. which specific statistical tests were used.] </li>
<li>  For the main outcomes provide a numerical result if appropriate (it nearly  always is) and a measure of its precision (e.g. 95% confidence interval). </li>
 <li> Describe any adverse events/outcomes or side effects. </li>
 <li> Describe the main limitations of the study. </li>
</ul>
 
<h3>Conclusions</h3>

<p>Provide a general interpretation of the results with any important  recommendations for future research.</p>

<a name="systematic_reviews"></a>
<h5>b. Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses</h5>
<p>Reports of systematic reviews and meta-analyses should use the <a href="http://www.prisma-statement.org/">PRISMA statement</a> as a guide, 
and include a completed PRISMA checklist and flow diagram to accompany the main text. 
Blank templates of the checklist and flow diagram can be downloaded from 
the <a href="http://www.prisma-statement.org/statement.htm">PRISMA Web site</a>.
Authors must also state within the Methods section of their paper whether a protocol 
exists for their systematic review, and if so, provide a copy of the protocol as supporting information. 
The journal supports the prospective registration of systematic reviews. Authors whose systematic review 
was prospectively registered (e.g. in a registry such as <a href="http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/">PROSPERO</a>) should also provide the registry number in 
their abstract. Registry details and protocols will be made available to editors and reviewers, and included 
alongside the paper for readers if the report is ultimately published. </p>
