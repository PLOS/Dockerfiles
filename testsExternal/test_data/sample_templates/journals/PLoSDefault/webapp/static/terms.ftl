    through which it strives to make the world's scientific and medical literature a freely available public
    resource. By using PLOS Sites and any services accessible from PLOS Sites
    (including PLOS API, as defined below), you are agreeing to be bound by the following terms and
    conditions ("Terms of Use"). If you do not agree to these Terms of Use, do not visit or use the PLOS Sites.

  <h2>Special Considerations for International Use</h2>
  <p>
    Recognizing the global nature of the Internet, you agree to comply with all local rules

    in which you reside.
  </p>

  <h2>General Terms</h2>
  <p>
    These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and PLOS and govern your use
    of PLOS Sites, superseding any prior agreements between you and PLOS (including, but not
    limited to, any prior versions of the Terms of Use) and any prior representations by PLOS.
    These Terms of Use shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
    State of California, without regard to conflicts of law principles.  The failure of PLOS
    to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Use shall not constitute a
    waiver of such right or provision.  If any provision of the Terms of Use is found by a
    court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the
    court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the
    provision, and the other provisions of the Terms of Use remain in full force and effect.
    You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action
    brought against PLOS and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, co-branders, or other
    partners and employees, arising out of or related to use of PLOS Sites or the Terms of Use
    must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever
    barred.  The section titles in the Terms of Use are for convenience only and have no legal or
    contractual effect.
