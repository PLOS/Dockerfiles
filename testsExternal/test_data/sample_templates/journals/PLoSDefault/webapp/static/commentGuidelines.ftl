<h2>1. Overview of Comments</h2>

<p>PLOS journal Web sites provide the ability for users to comment on articles to facilitate community evaluation and
  discourse around published articles.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Comments:</strong> Comments should be used to make additions or clarifications, identify and link to
    material, and are designed to lead to threaded discussions concerning the content, conclusions, and consequences of
    a specific article.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Authors of all Comments will be identified by their PLOS 'user name'.</p>

<a id="terms" name="terms"></a>
<h2>2. Terms of Use</h2>

<@s.url action="terms" namespace="/static" includeParams="none" id="termsURL"/>
<p>All Comments and other post-publication activity in PLOS Web sites are subject to
  the <@s.a href="${termsURL}" title="Terms of Use">PLOS Terms of Use</@s.a>. </p>

<a id="who" name="who"></a>
<h2>3. Who Can Contribute?</h2>

<p>All registered users are able to add Comments to any article. Anyone can register as a user. Users are required to
  unambiguously identify themselves with their first and last names, their geographic location, and a valid e-mail
  address in order to register. First and last name and geographic location are made public, however e-mail addresses
  are private. The e-mail address and other registration fields that the user chooses to make private will be kept
  strictly confidential by PLOS staff unless otherwise indicated. Discussion and ratings are not anonymous. PLOS
  reserves the right to suspend the privileges of any registered user. Any registered user who is found to have provided
  false name or location information will have their account suspended and any postings deleted.</p>

<a id="comments" name="comments"></a>
<h2>4. How to Add and View Comments</h2>

<p>To add a Comment about an article, first make sure you are logged into the Web site. To create a Comment, click the
  "Make a general comment" link in the right-hand navigation menu of the article. Enter a title and text for your
  comment in the appropriate boxes.</p>

<p>We advise that Comments are first written in a word-processing program that allows for spell checking before they are
  copied and pasted into the Comment field. When you are satisfied with the text, click "Post" to attach the Comment to
  the article. Any correctly formed URLs in the Comment text field will automatically become working links. </p>

<p>To view all Comments on an article, along with any replies, click the "Comments" tab at the top of the article.</p>

<a id="corrections" name="corrections"></a>
<h2>5. How to Add and View Corrections</h2>

<p>Two kinds of Corrections can be posted directly to an article: Minor Corrections and Formal Corrections. Minor
  Corrections indicate small errors and clarifications to the article, whereas Formal Corrections are reserved for
  errors that significantly affect the utility or understanding of the article. Formal Corrections are also sent to
  PubMed Central and PubMed. In both cases, the decision to indicate a posting as a Minor or Formal Correction is the
  responsibility of PLOS staff. </p>

<p>To make a Correction, first make sure you are logged into the Web site. We advise that Corrections are first written
  in a word-processing program that allows for spell checking before they are copied and pasted into the Comment field.
  Copy and paste the portion of the article to be corrected. Below that, include the text as it should display. Once
  your Correction is prepared, copy and paste the text into a Comment box and select the checkbox that indicates that
  this Comment is a Correction. Enter a title for your Correction in the appropriate box. When you are satisfied with
  the text, click "Post" to attach the Correction to the article. </p>

<p>The Correction will initially appear as a Comment but will be promptly reviewed by PLOS staff. After the Comment is
  reviewed, it will either stay as a Comment or be changed to a Minor Correction or Formal Correction. Once a Comment is
  changed to a Correction, the Correction will display at the bottom of the main article tab. To view the complete text
  of a Correction or the citation information of a Correction, click the title of the Correction.</p>

<p>Formal Corrections are also listed above the title of the article. The title of the Formal Correction and a link to
  the Formal Corrections appear in this block.</p>

<a id="responding" name="responding"></a>
<h2>6. Responding to Comments and Corrections</h2>

<p>To respond to a Comment or Correction click the "Respond to this Posting" link in the bottom-right corner of the
  window. Enter a title and text for your response in the appropriate boxes. We advise that responses first are written
  in a word-processing program that allows for spell checking before they are copied and pasted into the comment field.
  When you are satisfied with the text, click "Post" to attach the response to the Comment or Correction. Any
  correctly formed URLs in the response text field will automatically become working links.</p>

<p>Following this procedure, up to twelve branching threads can be anchored to an initial Comment or
  Correction. If any contribution is removed following moderation, all subsequent responses along its thread will also
  be removed. </p>

<a id="goodpractice" name="goodpractice"></a>
<h2>7. Good Practice</h2>

<p>All contributions must conform to the norms of civilized scientific discussion. Any contributions that do not meet
  these standards will be removed. Any users who consistently transgress these conventions will have their user
  privileges removed.</p>

<p>A partial list of discussion standards includes the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Language that is insulting, inflammatory, or obscene will not be tolerated.</li>
  <li>Unsupported assertions or statements should be avoided. Comments must be evidence-based, not
    authority-based.
  </li>
  <li>When previously published studies are cited, they must be accurately referenced and,
    where possible, a DOI and link to a publicly accessible version supplied.
  </li>
  <li>Unpublished data should be provided with sufficient methodological detail for those data
    to be assessed. Alternatively, a permanent Web link to such information should be provided.
  </li>
  <li>Arguments based on belief are to be avoided. For example the assertion, "I don't believe
    the results in Figure 2." must be supported.
  </li>
  <li>Discussions should be confined to the demonstrable content of articles and should avoid
    speculation about the motivations or prejudices of authors.
  </li>
  <li>Questions about experimental data are appropriate, but need to be phrased in a way that does not imply any misconduct
    on the part of the authors. If a reader is concerned about potential misconduct, such concerns must always be raised
    with senior editorial staff at PLOS (see <@s.a href="${contactURL}" title="Journal Contact Information">Journal
    Contact Information</@s.a>).
  </li>
</ol>

<p>PLOS is the final arbiter of the suitability of content for inclusion in PLOS Web sites.</p>

<h2>8. Requesting Review of Inappropriate Content</h2>

<p>We encourage you to request review of a Comment you believe to be inappropriate using the "Request review"
  link in the bottom-right corner of the window. Indicate why the content should be reviewed ("Spam," "Offensive,"
  "Inappropriate," or "Other"), enter additional information in the text box, and click "Submit". PLOS staff will
  investigate the content, which may involve consulting external experts if necessary. Any content that PLOS staff deem
  to be inappropriate will be removed. Any users who consistently post inappropriate material will have their user
  privileges removed. If any contribution is removed, all subsequent responses along its thread will also be
  removed.</p>
