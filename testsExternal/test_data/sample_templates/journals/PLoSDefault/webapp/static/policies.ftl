<h2>1.  Relationship between PLOS Journals</h2>
<p>All journals published by PLOS are autonomous publications.</p>

<p><b><em><a href="http://www.plosbiology.org/">PLOS Biology</a></em> and <em><a href="http://www.plosmedicine.org/">PLOS Medicine</b></a></em>.
  Each of these two journals has a team of professional and academic editors who evaluate papers for publication.
  If a manuscript that falls between basic and clinical research is submitted to
  <em>PLOS Biology</em> or <em>PLOS Medicine</em>, the professional editors of both journals may consult
  each other on such manuscripts to ensure the fairest possible treatment. As a result,
  authors who have submitted their manuscript to <em>PLOS Medicine</em> may be encouraged instead to
  submit their paper to <em>PLOS Biology</em> (and vice versa).</p>

<p><b>PLOS Community Journals.</b> <em><a href="http://www.ploscompbiol.org/">PLOS Computational Biology</a></em>,
  <em><a href="http://www.plosgenetics.org/">PLOS Genetics</a></em>, <em><a href="http://www.plospathogens.org/">PLOS Pathogens</a></em>, and
  <em><a href="http://www.plosntds.org/">PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</a></em> are run solely and independently
  by their own Editors-in-Chief and community-based editorial boards.</p>

<p><b><em><a href="http://www.plosone.org/">PLOS ONE</a></em>.</b> This journal is run independently from
  the other journals by a community-based editorial board.</p>

<p><b>Transfer of papers.</b> Authors can request that papers (with referee reports, if relevant)
  rejected from one PLOS journal be transferred to another PLOS journal for further consideration there.
  We trust that reviewers for any PLOS journal are willing to have their reviews considered by
  the editors of another PLOS journal. Papers will never be transferred between the
  journals without an author's consent.</p>

<a name="publication"></a>
<h2>2. Publication Charges</h2>
<p>To provide open access, PLOS journals use a business model in which our expenses&mdash;including those of peer review, journal production, and online hosting and archiving&mdash;are recovered in part by charging a publication fee to the authors or research sponsors for each article they publish. The <a href="http://www.plos.org/publish/pricing-policy/publication-fees/">fees</a> vary by journal.</p>

<p>PLOS is committed to the widest possible global participation in open access publishing. To determine the appropriate fee, we use a country-based pricing model, which is based on the country that provides 50% or more of the primary funding for the research that is being submitted. Research articles funded by Upper Middle and High Income Countries incur our <a href="http://www.plos.org/publish/pricing-policy/publication-fees/">standard publication fees</a>. Corresponding authors who are affiliated with one of our <a href="http://www.plos.org/support-us/institutional-membership/members-list/">Institutional Members</a> are eligible for a discount on this fee. Such authors will be informed of the discount applicable after submission of their manuscript.</p>

<p>Fees for Low and Lower Middle Income Countries are calculated according to the <a href="http://www.plos.org/about/viewpoints/global-participation-initiative/">PLOS Global Participation Initiative</a> pricing program for manuscripts submitted after 9am Pacific Time on September 4, 2012 (this program is not retroactive).
<ul>
  <li>Group One: Countries from this <a href="http://www.plos.org/group-one-countries/">list</a> will not be charged for publishing
  </li>
  <li>Group Two: Countries from this <a href="http://www.plos.org/group-two-countries/">list</a> will be charged a flat $500
  </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Our fee waiver policy, whereby PLOS offers to waive or further reduce the payment required of authors who cannot pay the full amount charged for publication, remains in effect. Editors and reviewers have no access to whether authors are able to pay; decisions to publish are only based on editorial criteria.</p>

<a name="copyright"></a>
<h2>3.  Copyright and License Policies</h2>
<p><b>Open access agreement.</b> Upon submission of an article,
  its authors are asked to indicate their agreement to abide by an
  open access Creative Commons license (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC-BY</a>). Under the terms of
  this license, authors retain ownership of the copyright of their articles.
  However, the license permits any user to download, print out, extract,
  reuse, archive, and distribute the article, so long as appropriate
  credit is given to the authors and source of the work. The license ensures
  that the authors' article will be available as widely as possible and
  that the article can be included in any scientific archive.</p>

<p><b>Open access agreement: US government authors.</b> Papers authored by one or
  more US government employees are not copyrighted, but are licensed under a Creative
  Commons public domain license (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/">CC0</a>), which
  allows unlimited distribution and reuse
  of the article for any lawful purpose. Authors should read about <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC-BY</a>
  or <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/">CC0</a> before submitting papers.</p>

<p><b>Archiving in PubMed Central.</b> Upon publication, PLOS also deposits all articles in <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/">PubMed Central</a>.
  This complies with the policies of funding agencies, such as the <a href="http://publicaccess.nih.gov/">NIH</a> in the USA, the
  <a href="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/About-us/Policy/Spotlight-issues/Open-access/index.htm">Wellcome Trust</a>,
  and the <a href="http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/access/Pages/Accessibility.aspx">Research Councils</a> in the UK,
  and the <a href="http://www.dfg.de/en/index.jsp">Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</a> in Germany,
  which request or require deposition of the published articles that they fund into publicly
  available databases.</p>

<a href="#contents">Back to Contents</a>

<a name="author"></a>
<h2>4.  Author Status</h2>
<p><b>Process.</b> All authors will be contacted by email at submission to ensure that they are
  aware of and approve the submission of the manuscript, its content, and its authorship.
  Some PLOS journals also require that all co-authors then confirm their assent to publication by email.</p>

<p><b>Professional medical writers.</b> The involvement of any professional medical writer in
  the publication process must be declared. We encourage authors to consult the <a href="http://www.emwa.org/Mum/EMWAguidelines.pdf">European
    Medical Writers' Association Guidelines</a> on the role of medical writers.</p>

<p><b>Authorship criteria.</b> All PLOS journals base their criteria for authorship on those
  outlined in the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) <a href="http://www.icmje.org/urm_main.html">Uniform
    Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals</a>, which are excerpted below.
  The contributions of all authors must be described. Contributions that fall short of
  authorship should be mentioned in the Acknowledgments section of the paper.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Authorship credit should be based on 1) substantial contributions to conception and
    design, acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data; 2) drafting the article
    or revising it critically for important intellectual content; and 3) final approval of the
    version to be published. Authors should meet conditions 1, 2, and 3.</em></li>
  <li><em>When a large, multicenter group has conducted the work, the group should
    identify the individuals who accept direct responsibility for the manuscript (3).
    These individuals should fully meet the criteria for authorship/contributorship defined above,
    and editors will ask these individuals to complete journal-specific author and conflict-of-interest
    disclosure forms. When submitting a manuscript authored by a group, the corresponding author should
    clearly indicate the preferred citation and identify all individual authors as well as the group name.
    Journals generally list other members of the group in the Acknowledgments. The NLM indexes the group
    name and the names of individuals the group has identified as being directly responsible for
    the manuscript; it also lists the names of collaborators if they are listed in Acknowledgments.</em></li>
  <li><em>Acquisition of funding, collection of data, or general supervision of the research group alone does not constitute authorship.</em></li>
  <li><em>All persons designated as authors should qualify for authorship, and all those who qualify should be listed.</em></li>
  <li><em>Each author should have participated sufficiently in the work to take public responsibility for appropriate portions of the content.</em></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Changes in authorship.</b> PLOS journals follow the <a href="http://www.publicationethics.org/">COPE guidelines</a> covering changes
  in authorship. If any changes to the list of authors of a manuscript are necessary after
  the initial submission of a manuscript to a PLOS journal but before its publication, the
  corresponding author must first contact the journal staff and provide a clear reason for the
  change(s). If the change to the authorship list is appropriate and in keeping with the guidelines
  given above, the corresponding author will be asked to provide written confirmation that all other
  authors listed on the manuscript at that time consent to the change(s). Any individuals who the
  corresponding author asks to be added or removed from the list of authors will be contacted by PLOS.</p>

<a href="#contents">Back to Contents</a>

<a name="competing"></a>
<h2>5.  Competing Interests</h2>
<p><b>PLOS policy on competing interests.</b> PLOS is committed to ensuring that research is as
  free from bias as possible and is seen to be so. It is increasingly recognized that
  everyone &mdash; authors, authors' employers (e.g., an academic institution, government department, commercial
  company, or other), sponsors of the work, reviewers, editors, and publishers &mdash; has competing interests
  of some sort. It is difficult for individual readers to assess objectively whether competing interests
  could have biased the presentation of, peer review of, or decision to publish a given work. Transparency
  of competing interests allows readers to better evaluate the possibility of such bias.
  Journals and their editors must take all competing interests into account during the review process and
  ensure that any relevant ones are declared in the published article. PLOS journals therefore have
  the following three requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Authors must declare all relevant competing interests for consideration during the review process.</li>
  <li>Editors (professional or academic, paid or unpaid) and reviewers must declare their own competing
    interests and if necessary disqualify themselves from involvement in the assessment of a paper.</li>
  <li>Anyone who comments on or rates published papers in any PLOS journal must declare
    their competing interests at the time of posting their comments and/or rating.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Explanation of competing interests.</h3>
<p><em>What is a competing interest?</em><br/>
  PLOS defines a competing interest as anything that interferes with, or could reasonably be
  perceived as interfering with, the full and objective presentation, peer review, editorial decision-making,
  or publication of research or non-research articles submitted to one of the journals. Competing interests
  can be financial or non-financial, professional, or personal. Competing interests can arise in relationship
  to an organization or another person. See below for definitions and examples of various competing interests.</p>

<p><em>Who needs to declare competing interests?</em><br/>
  Everyone involved in authorship, funding, review, and editorial decision-making of submitted
  articles, or who wishes to comment on or rate published articles, must declare any and
  all relevant competing interests.</p>


<p><em>How do PLOS journals treat competing interests in their review and publication process?</em><br/>
  No decision is made to publish any paper submitted to a PLOS journal until a competing interests statement
  has been submitted for all authors. The editors may ask for clarification about declarations. The role of all
  funding sources in the work must be described and authors must state explicitly whether the funder was involved in
  the: study design; collection, analysis, and interpretation of data; writing of the paper; and/or decision to
  submit for publication. If the funder was involved, the role/contribution must be described explicitly.</p>
<p>The editors of a PLOS journal might decide not to publish a paper if they believe the competing interests
  declared by the authors or funders might have compromised the objectivity or validity of the research, analyses,
  or interpretations in the paper. PLOS editors will not publish a commissioned or any other non-research article
  if they are aware of a competing interest that, in their judgment, could introduce bias or a reasonable perception of bias.
  PLOS editors do not consult reviewers who have competing interests that, in the editors' judgment, could
  interfere with unbiased review.
  Failure to declare competing interests at submission, or when an article is commissioned, can result in
  immediate rejection of the paper. If a competing interest comes to light after publication,
  PLOS journal will issue a formal correction to or retraction of the whole paper, as appropriate.</p>

<h3>Examples of competing interests.</h3>
<h4><em>Financial</em></h4>
<p>Financial competing interests include but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>ownership of stocks or shares;</li>
  <li>paid employment or consultancy;</li>
  <li>board membership;</li>
  <li>patent applications (pending or actual), including individual applications or those belonging to the institution to which the
    authors are affiliated and from which the authors may benefit;</li>
  <li>research grants (from any source, restricted or unrestricted);</li>
  <li>travel grants and honoraria for speaking or participation at meetings;</li>
  <li>gifts.</li>
</ul>

<p>Authors must declare all potential financial competing interests involving people or organizations that might
  reasonably be perceived as relevant. Similarly, reviewers and academic and professional editors, paid or unpaid, must declare
  any financial relationships that could reasonably be perceived as relevant and/or could influence their objective review of the paper;
  if a financial competing interest exists, these individuals should recuse themselves from handling the paper. Anyone wishing to
  comment on or rate a published paper must also disclose any relevant financial interests.
  As a guide, any competing interest that arose within the five years either before or after the commencement of the research described,
  or within five years of the article being written, or within five years of events described in the article, should be declared.
  However, interests outside this time-frame might also be relevant; if so, they should also be declared so that their relevance
  can be judged by the journal editorial team.</p>


<h4><em>Non-financial</em></h4>
<p>Non-financial competing interests include but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
  <b><em>Professional:</em></b>
  <ul>
    <li>acting as an expert witness; </li>
    <li>membership in a government or other advisory board;</li>
    <li>relationship (paid or unpaid) with organizations and funding bodies including nongovernmental organizations,
      research institutions, or charities;</li>
    <li>membership of lobbying or advocacy organizations;</li>
    <li>writing or consulting for an educational company.</li>
  </ul>
  <br/>
  <b><em>Personal:</em></b>
  <ul>
    <li>personal relationships (i.e. friend, spouse, family member, current or previous mentor, adversary) with individuals involved in the
      submission or evaluation of a paper, such as authors, reviewers, editors, or members of the editorial board of a PLOS journal;</li>
    <li>personal convictions (political, religious, ideological, or other) related to a paper's topic that might interfere with an unbiased
      publication process (at the stage of authorship, peer review, editorial decision-making, or publication).</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<p>Authors, reviewers, editors, and anyone wishing to comment on a published paper must disclose any non-financial
  interests that might influence their reporting, handling, or review of the paper, or that might be negatively or
  positively affected by publication of the paper.</p>

<p>For example, authors are required to declare whether they have served or currently
  serve on the editorial board of the journal to which they are submitting, have acted as an expert
  witness in relevant legal proceedings, or have sat or currently sit on a committee for an organization
  that may benefit from publication of the paper.</p>

<p>Reviewers are required to declare whether they have held grants, co-authored papers, or worked in the same institution or organization
  with the authors of the study they are asked to review, or if they are in an adversarial relationship with the authors.</p>

<p>Similarly, editors &mdash; academic or professional, paid or unpaid &mdash; are required to recuse themselves from deliberations
  if they cannot evaluate a paper in an objective way because of personal relationships with the authors.</p>

<p>Finally, anyone who comments on or rates published papers for PLOS must declare non-financial competing interests at the time
  of posting their comments and/or rating.</p>

<a name="animal"></a>
<h2>6.  Human and Animal Research</h2>
<p><b>Research involving human participants.</b> All research involving human participants must have been approved by the authors'
  institutional review board or equivalent committee(s), and that board must be named in the manuscript.
  For research involving human participants, informed consent must have been obtained (or the reason for lack of consent
  explained &mdash; for example, that the data were analyzed anonymously) and all clinical investigation must have been conducted
  according to the principles expressed in the <em><a href="http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/b3/index.html">Declaration of Helsinki</a></em>. Authors should be able to submit, upon request,
  a statement from the research ethics committee or institutional review board indicating approval of the research.
  PLOS editors also encourage authors to submit a sample of a patient consent form, and might require submission on particular occasions.</p>

<p>For studies involving humans categorized by race/ethnicity, age, disease/disabilities, religion, sex/gender, sexual orientation, or other socially
  constructed groupings, authors should, as much as possible:</p>

<ul>
  <li>make explicit their methods of categorizing human populations;</li>
  <li>define categories in as much detail as the study protocol allows;</li>
  <li>justify their choices of definitions and categories, including for example whether any rules of human
    categorization were required by their funding agency;</li>
  <li>explain whether (and, if so, how) they controlled for confounding variables such as socioeconomic status,
    nutrition, environmental exposures, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, outmoded terms and potentially stigmatizing labels should be changed to more current,
  acceptable terminology &mdash; for example: 'Caucasian' should be changed to 'white' or 'of [western] European descent' (as appropriate);
  'cancer victims' should be changed to 'patients with cancer.'</p>

<p><b>Reporting of animal studies and ethical treatment of animals.</b> For studies involving animals, all work must have
  been conducted according to applicable national and international guidelines. Prior approval must have been obtained
  for all protocols from the relevant author's institutional or other appropriate ethics committee, and the institution
  name and permit numbers must be provided at submission (see example below). For research involving non-human primates,
  all studies must be performed in accordance with the recommendations of the Weatherall (2006) report, <em><a href="http://www.acmedsci.ac.uk/images/project/nhpdownl.pdf">
    The use of non-human primates in research</a></em>. Where unregulated animals are used or ethics approval is not required by a specific committee,
  the article should include a clear statement of this fact and the reasons why ethical approval is not required.</p>
<p>We also strongly encourage all authors to comply with the '<em>Animal Research: Reporting In Vivo Experiments</em>' <a href="http://www.nc3rs.org.uk/page.asp?id=1357">(ARRIVE)
  guidelines</a>, developed by <a href="http://www.nc3rs.org.uk/">NC3Rs</a> to improve standards of reporting to ensure that the data from animal experiments can be
  fully scrutinized and utilized. Relevant information should be included in the appropriate section of the article (e.g.
  title, abstract, or method), as outlined in the ARRIVE guidelines. The ARRIVE guidelines can be applied to any area of
  bioscience research using laboratory animals. Where research could be confused as pertaining to human clinical research, the animal model should also be noted in the article title.</p>

<p><b>Example of statement of ethical approval.</b>
  <em>This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use
    of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The protocol was approved by the Committee on
    the Ethics of Animal Experiments of the University of Minnesota (Permit Number: 27-2956). All surgery was
    performed under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia, and every effort was made to minimize suffering.</em><br/></p>

<a name="sharing"></a>
<h2>7.  Sharing of Materials, Methods, and Data</h2>
<p>Publication is conditional upon the agreement of the authors to make freely available any
  materials and information described in their publication that may be reasonably requested by others for
  the purpose of academic, non-commercial research.</p>

<p><b>Availability of data and materials.</b> PLOS is committed to ensuring the availability of data and materials that
  underpin any articles published in PLOS journals. PLOS's ideal is to make all data relevant to
  a given article and all readily replaceable materials immediately available without restrictions
  (while not compromising confidentiality in the context of human-subject research).</p>

<p>We appreciate, however, that this ideal is not yet the norm in all fields. We are therefore
  collaborating with a number of subject-specific initiatives in order to develop relevant policies.
  In the meantime, authors must comply with <a href="guidelines#accessionnumbers">current best
    practice in their discipline for the
    sharing of data through databases:</a> for example, deposition of microarray data in ArrayExpress or GEO;
  deposition of gene sequences in GenBank, EMBL or DDBJ; and deposition of ecological data in Dryad. We
  encourage all authors to comply with available field-specific standards for the preparation and
  recording of data; for more information, see below (section 8, <a href="#reporting">Reporting Guidelines for Specific Study Designs</a>). Where no field-specific database exists, authors can deposit data in <a href="http://www.datadryad.org/">Dryad</a>.</p>

<p>Failure to comply with this policy will be taken into account when publication decisions are made.
  PLOS journal editors encourage researchers to contact them if they encounter difficulties in obtaining data
  or materials from articles published in PLOS journals. PLOS reserves the right to post corrections on articles,
  to contact authors' institutions and funders, and in extreme cases to withdraw publication, if restrictions on
  access to data or materials come to light after publication of a PLOS journal article.</p>

<p>Data for which public repositories have been established should be deposited before publication, and the appropriate
  accession numbers or digital object identifiers (DOIs) published with the paper.</p>

<p>If an appropriate repository does not exist, data should be provided in an open access institutional repository, a general data repository such as Dryad, or as Supporting Information files with the published paper. If none of these options is practical, data should be made freely available upon request.</p>

<p>The conclusions of a study must not depend solely on the analysis of proprietary data. If proprietary data were
  used to reach a conclusion, and the authors are unwilling or unable to make these data public, then the paper must
  include an analysis of public data that validates the conclusions so that others can reproduce the analysis and build on the findings.
  Any restrictions on the availability or use of datasets might be judged to diminish the significance of a paper
  and may therefore influence the decision about whether a paper should be published. These policies have been developed
  in accordance with the principles established in <em><a href="http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?isbn=0309088593">Sharing Publication-Related Data and
    Materials</a></em> (National Academies Press, 2003).</p>

<a name="software"></a>
<p><b>Software.</b> PLOS supports the development of open source software and believes that, for
  submissions in which software is the central part of the paper, adherence to appropriate open
  source standards will ensure that the submission conforms to (1) our requirements that methods
  be described in sufficient detail that another researcher can reproduce the experiments described,
  (2) our aim to promote openness in research, and (3) our intention that all work published in PLOS
  journals can be built upon by future researchers. Therefore, if new software or a new algorithm is central to a
  PLOS paper, the authors must confirm that the software conforms to the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/docs/osd">Open Source Definition</a>, have deposited the
  following three items in an open software archive, and included in the submission as Supporting Information:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>The associated source code of the software described by the paper.</b>
    This should, as far as possible, follow accepted community standards and be licensed under a suitable license
    such as BSD, LGPL, or MIT (see <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical">http://www.opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical</a>
    for a full list). Dependency
    on commercial software such as Mathematica and MATLAB does not preclude a paper from consideration, although
    complete open source solutions are preferred.</li>
  <li><b>Documentation for running and installing the software.</b> For end-user applications, instructions for
    installing and using the software are prerequisite; for software libraries, instructions for using the
    application program interface are prerequisite.</li>
  <li><b>A test dataset with associated control parameter settings.</b> Where feasible, results from standard
    test sets should be included. Where possible, test data should not have any dependencies &mdash; for example, a database dump.</li>
</ul>

<p>Acceptable archives should provide a public repository of the described software. The code should be easy to locate and download without the requirement for creating user accounts, logging in or otherwise registering personal details. The repository must have been in existence for over five years or be hosting more than 1,000 projects. Examples of such archives are: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</a>, <a href="http://www.bioinformatics.org/">Bioinformatics.Org</a>,
  <a href="http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/Main_Page">Open Bioinformatics Foundation (O|B|F)</a>, <a href="http://code.google.com/">Google Code</a>,
  <a href="http://developer.berlios.de/">BerliOS Developer</a>,
  <a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/">Savannah</a>, <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> and the <a href="http://codehaus.org/">Codehaus</a>. Authors should provide a direct link to the
  deposited software from within the paper.</p>

<p>Deposition with the journal and in an open source archive ensures that the original source associated with the
  paper is available as well as any enhancements made after the paper is published. An article can be considered for
  publication if it covers a well-established project that has been providing an open source code repository for an extended amount of time.
  A condition of acceptance is that the software can be run by reviewers accessing the public software and that the
  results presented in the paper are reproducible. The software need run on only one hardware-software platform in
  common use by the readership (including MATLAB), although it must run without dependencies on proprietary or otherwise
  unobtainable ancillary software. Articles describing software that requires access to databases and other resources
  whose persistence is not guaranteed (e.g. individual laboratory databases without funding support) will not be considered.
  In addition, the results described in the paper must be reproducible when peer reviewers, editors, or readers run
  the software on the deposited dataset and with the provided control parameters.</p>

<p>When the software or algorithm is not central to the paper, we nevertheless encourage authors to make all relevant materials freely available.</p>

<a href="#contents">Back to Contents</a>

<a name="reporting"></a>
<h2>8.  Reporting Guidelines for Specific Study Designs</h2>

<p>Authors should check the <a href="http://www.equator-network.org/">EQUATOR Network</a> site for any reporting guidelines that apply to their study design, and ensure that any required
  Supporting Information (checklists, protocols, flowcharts, etc.) be included in the article submission.</p>

<p><b>Clinical trials.</b> PLOS follows the <a href="http://www.who.int/ictrp/en/">WHO definition</a> of a clinical
  trial: "...any research study that prospectively assigns human participants or groups of
  humans to one or more health-related interventions to evaluate the effects on health outcomes...Interventions
  include but are not restricted to drugs, cells and other biological products, surgical procedures,
  radiologic procedures, devices, behavioural treatments, process-of-care changes, preventive care, etc."</p>

<p>PLOS supports the position of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE)
  on trial registration. All trials initiated from 1 July 2005 must be registered prospectively in
  a publicly accessible registry (i.e., before patient recruitment has begun) or they will not be
  considered for publication. For trials initiated before 1 July 2005, all trials must be registered
  before submission to any PLOS journal. The <a href="http://www.icmje.org/faq_clinical.html">ICMJE FAQ</a> on trial registration has further details, and
  WHO provides a list of <a href="http://www.who.int/ictrp/network/primary/en/index.html">approved registries</a>. PLOS editors reserve the right to inform authors'
  institutions or ethics committees if they become aware of unregistered trials.</p>

<p>Authors of trials must adhere to the CONSORT reporting guidelines appropriate to their
  trial design, available on the <a href="http://www.consort-statement.org/">CONSORT Statement Website</a>. Before the paper can enter peer review,
  authors must: (1) record, in the paper trial registry, the trial registration number and institutional
  review board, and (2) provide a copy of the trial protocol and a completed CONSORT checklist as supporting
  information (these documents will also be published alongside the paper, if accepted). The CONSORT flow
  diagram must be included as the manuscript's "Figure 1." Any deviation from the trial protocol must be
  explained in the paper. Authors must explicitly discuss informed consent in their paper, and PLOS
  reserves the right to ask for a copy of the patient consent form. Information on statistical methods
  or participants, beyond that indicated in the CONSORT statement, should be reported in the Methods section.</p>


<p>PLOS supports the public disclosure of all clinical trial results, as mandated, for example, by the FDA Amendments
  Act, 2007. Prior disclosure of results on a
  clinical trial registry site will not affect the decision to peer review or accept papers in PLOS journals.</p>

<p><b>Systematic reviews and meta-analyses.</b> Reports of systematic reviews and meta-analyses should use the PRISMA statement as a guide,
  and include a completed PRISMA checklist and flow diagram to accompany the main text. Blank templates of the checklist
  and flow diagram can be downloaded from the <a href="http://www.prisma-statement.org/statement.htm">PRISMA Web site</a>. Authors must also state within their Methods section whether
  a protocol exists for their systematic review, and if so, provide a copy of the protocol as Supporting Information.
  The journal supports the prospective registration of systematic reviews. Authors whose systematic review was prospectively
  registered (e.g. in a registry such as <a href="http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/">PROSPERO</a>) should also provide the registry number in their abstract. Registry details
  and protocols will be made available to editors and reviewers, and included alongside the paper for readers if the report is
  ultimately published.</p>

<p><b>Diagnostic studies.</b> Reports of studies of diagnostic accuracy should conform to the <a href="http://www.stard-statement.org/">STARD requirements.</a></p>

<p><b>Epidemiological studies.</b> For reports of epidemiological studies, authors should consult the <a href="http://www.strobe-statement.org/">STROBE initiative</a>.</p>

<p><b>Microarray experiments.</b> Reports of microarray experiments should conform to the <a href="http://www.mged.org/Workgroups/MIAME/miame.html">MIAME guidelines</a> published by the
  Functional Genomics Data Society (FGED), and the data from the experiments must be deposited in a publicly accessible database.</p>

<p><b>Checklists for biological and biomedical research investigations.</b> PLOS recommends that authors refer to
  the MIBBI Portal (<a href="http://www.mibbi.org/index.php/MIBBI_portal">Minimum Information for Biological and Biomedical Investigations</a>) for prescriptive checklists
  for reporting biological and biomedical research where applicable.</p>

<h2>9.  Policies Regarding Submission of a New Taxon Name</h2>

<p><b>Zoological names.</b> When publishing papers that describe a new zoological taxon name,
  PLOS aims to comply with the requirements of the <a href="http://iczn.org/">International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature
    (ICZN)</a>. However, the ICZN does not yet recognize online-only journals, and so, unless PLOS adapts its
  publication process for taxonomic papers (which it does, as detailed below), any scientific animal name
  published by PLOS would not be considered 'available' under the rules of the Code ('available' is the formal
  term for legally published under the Code, and is equivalent to the term 'nomenclaturally valid' in botanical literature).
  There is a <a href="http://iczn.org/content/availability-electronic-publication">proposal to amend the Code to accommodate online-only publication</a>,
  which, as of February 2011, awaits an ICZN vote.</p>


<p>Until acceptance of this amendment, the ICZN has proposed an interim solution for authors
  publishing in PLOS journals that allows PLOS to comply with the code by providing a limited
  hardcopy print run of the article and making it publicly obtainable. Therefore, for all papers that
  include the naming of a new zoological taxon, PLOS will make a printed version available for outside
  parties (at a cost of $10, to cover postage and printing) at the same time as the publication of the
  online open access article. This additional printed version of the article will contain text in the
  footer of the first page. This text will be added by PLOS staff, and, apart from this new footer,
  the printed version will be identical to the PDF of the online version. Footer text: <em>"This printed
    document was produced by a method that assures numerous identical and durable copies, and those
    copies were simultaneously obtainable for the purpose of providing a public and permanent scientific
    record, in accordance with Article 8.1 of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature. Date of
    publication: XXXXXXXX. This document is otherwise identical to DOI: XXXXX."</em></p>

<p>In addition, we ask that authors add the following information about archiving and ZooBank registration
  to the online version of the article before it is finally accepted.</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Digital archiving.</b> Please include the names of the digital archives where PLOS articles are deposited
    (currently, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/">PubMedCentral</a> and <a href="http://www.lockss.org/lockss/Home">LOCKSS</a>).
    If an author's institute (or those of co-authors)
    has its own repository, we recommend that authors also deposit the published online article
    there and include the names of such repositories in the article.</li>
  <li><b>ZooBank registration.</b> Authors should contact <a href="http://zoobank.org/">ZooBank</a> about the registration of the
    new species name and request a unique digital identifier (a Life Science Identifier [LSID]).
    The LSID also needs to be included in the published paper.  ZooBank has not yet been officially
    recognized by the ICZN, but it is still important to register there, because the ICZN are likely to
    request mandatory registration of new names in ZooBank for all online-only journals. </li>
</ul>

<p>The following paragraphs provide an example of the type of wording that we recommend for a new taxon
  description in a PLOS journal. The first paragraph below is required for the online-only version but
  is overruled by the footer note above, added to the print-only edition. The names of the libraries and
  institutional repositories should be included, as appropriate.</p>


<ul>
  <p><b>Please insert a modification of the following example text into the Methods section, in a subsection called
    'Nomenclatural Acts'.</b><br/>

    <em>The electronic version of this document does not represent a published work according to the
      International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN), and hence the nomenclatural acts contained in the
      electronic version are not available under that Code from the electronic edition. Therefore, a separate edition of
      this document was produced by a method that assures numerous identical and durable copies, and those copies were
      simultaneously obtainable (from the publication date noted on the first page of this article) for the purpose of providing
      a public and permanent scientific record, in accordance with Article 8.1 of the Code. The separate print-only edition is
      available on request from PLOS by sending a request to PLOS, 1160 Battery Street, Suite 100,
      San Francisco, CA 94111, USA along with a check for $10 (to cover printing and postage) payable to 'PLOS'.
      In addition, this published work and the nomenclatural acts it contains have been registered in ZooBank, the proposed
      online registration system for the ICZN. The ZooBank LSIDs (Life Science Identifiers) can be resolved and the associated
      information viewed through any standard web browser by appending the LSID to the prefix 'http://zoobank.org/'. The LSID
      for this publication is: [insert here]
      Anochetus boltoni Fisher sp. nov.
      urn:lsid:zoobank.org:act:B6C072CF-1CA6-40C7-8396-534E91EF7FBB
    </em></p>
</ul>

<p><b>Botanical names</b>. When publishing papers that describe a new botanical taxon name, PLOS aims to comply with the
  requirements of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN). Following from a test case (Knapp S [2010] PLOS ONE. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0010502) and in association with the <a href="http://www.ipni.org/">International Plant Names Index</a> (IPNI), the
  following guidelines for publication in an online-only journal have been agreed such that any scientific botanical name
  published by PLOS is considered effectively published under the rules of the Code. These guidelines differ from those
  for zoological nomenclature (see above) and will change in concert with the Code.
  The online version of the article in itself does not represent a published work according to the ICBN, and hence the
  new names contained in the online version are not effectively published under that Code from the online edition alone.</p>

<p>To comply with Article 29 of the code, therefore, we ask all authors (one author if the paper has multiple authors) to
  print out copies (in a single print run) of their paper from the relevant PLOS journal website on the day of publication
  and ensure that they post these copies on that day to multiple relevant institutions (ten are recommended in ICBN Rec. 30.2 of the Vienna Code), including the names indexing centre for the group in question (i.e. IPNI for flowering plants and
  ferns, <a href="http://www.mycobank.org/">MycoBank</a> and <a href="http://www.indexfungorum.org/names/names.asp">Index Fungorum</a> for fungi).
  Confirmation that the article has been posted can be added as a <a href="http://www.plosone.org/static/commentGuidelines">comment to
    the online publication</a>.</p>


<p>PLOS will also make a printed version available for outside parties (at a cost of $10, to cover postage and printing) of
  the online-only article (which remains freely available).</p>

<p>In addition, we ask that authors add the following information about archiving to the online version of the article before it is finally accepted.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Digital archiving.</b> Please include the names of the digital archives where PLOS articles are deposited (currently,
    <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/">PubMedCentral</a> and <a href="http://www.lockss.org/lockss/Home">LOCKSS</a>). If an author's institute (or those of co-authors) has its own repository, PLOS
    recommends that authors also deposit the published online article there and include the name of such repositories in their article.</li>
  <li><b>Unique digital identifier.</b> Please provide a unique digital identifier (a Globally Unique Identifier [GUID]; currently an LSID) that indicates
    listing in IPNI for flowering plants, ferns, and fern allies, or MycoBank/Index Fungorum number for fungi. The IPNI
    GUID/MB number/IF number also must
    be included in the published paper. We recommend that authors contact IPNI or MycoBank/Index Fungorum to request a unique digital identifier.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following paragraphs provide an example of the type of wording that is recommended for a new botanical taxon description in a PLOS journal.
  The names of the libraries and institutional repositories should be included, as appropriate.</p>

<ul>
  <p><b>Please insert a modification of the following example text into the Methods section, in a
    subsection called 'Nomenclatural Acts'</b> (taken from Knapp S [2010] PLOS ONE. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0010502).</p>

  <p><em>Nomenclature<br/>
    The electronic version of this document in itself does not represent a published work according to the
    International Code of Botanical Nomenclature, and hence the new names contained in the electronic version are not
    effectively published under that Code from the electronic edition alone. Therefore, a separate edition of this document
    was produced by a method that assures numerous identical printed copies, and those copies were simultaneously distributed
    (on the publication date noted on the first page of this article) for the purpose of providing a public and permanent
    scientific record, in accordance with Article 29 of the Code. Copies of the print-only edition of this article were
    distributed on the publication date to botanical or generally accessible libraries of the following institutions (BM,
    COL, GH, HUA, K, MEXU, MO, NY, QCA, QCNE, USM). The separate print-only edition is available on request from PLOS (Public
    Library of Science) by sending a request to PLOS, 1160 Battery Street, Suite 100, San Francisco, CA 94111,
    USA along with a check for $10 (to cover printing and postage) payable to 'PLOS'.<br/>
    In addition, new names contained in this work have been submitted to <a href="http://ipni.org/">IPNI</a>, from where they will be made available to the Global
    Names Index. The IPNI LSIDs (Life Science Identifiers) can be resolved and the associated information viewed through any
    standard web browser by appending the LSID contained in this publication to the prefix http://ipni.org/. The online version
    of this work is archived and available from the following digital repositories: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/">PubMedCentral</a>
    and <a href="http://www.nhm.ac.uk/research-curation/research/projects/solanaceaesource/">

</ul>


<p>The institutions listed are to be chosen by the author, and GUIDs are likely to replace LSIDs and should be cited
  where available. Also, neither MycoBank nor Index Fungorum
  has a local resolution service, so for fungal names please use, and refer to, the <a href="http://lsid.tdwg.org/">TDWG LSID resolver</a>.</p>

<p><b>Globally unique identifier.</b> In the results section, the GUID (LSID) should be listed under the new species name:<br/>

<h2>10.  Submission of Related Manuscripts</h2>

<p>When submitting an article, all authors are asked to indicate that
  they do not have a related or duplicate manuscript under consideration (or accepted) for publication elsewhere. If related work
  has been submitted elsewhere, then a copy must be included with the article submitted to PLOS. Reviewers will be asked to comment
  on the overlap between related submissions.</p>

<a href="#contents">Back to Contents</a>

<a name="exclusions"></a>
<h2>11.  Reviewer and Editor Exclusions</h2>
<p>Upon submission of a manuscript, authors are asked whether they wish to exclude any specific academic editors or reviewers
  from the peer review of their article. The editorial team will respect these requests so long as this does not interfere
  with the objective and thorough assessment of the article.
  See the relevant guidelines for reviewers and more general information on <a href="#competing">PLOS policy regarding competing interests</a>.</p>

<p>Editors and reviewers are required to treat all submitted manuscripts in strict confidence.</p>

<a href="#contents">Back to Contents</a>

<a name="corrections"></a>
<h2>13.  Corrections and Additions </h2>
<p>PLOS can post minor and formal corrections directly to the online version of the article. Minor corrections indicate small
  errors and clarifications to the article, whereas formal corrections are reserved for errors that significantly affect
  the utility or understanding of the article. Formal corrections are also indexed in PubMed Central and PubMed.
  The decision to indicate a posting as a minor or formal correction is the responsibility of PLOS staff.
  See the guidelines on <a href="commentGuidelines#corrections">How to Add and View Corrections</a> for more detail. It is also possible to send requests for
  formal corrections directly to the journal editorial staff.</p>

<a name="misconduct"></a>
<h2>14.  Publication Ethics</h2>
<p>All PLOS Journals are members of the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE), abide by its Code of Conduct and aim to adhere to its <a href="http://www.publicationethics.org/files/Code_of_conduct_for_journal_editors_Mar11.pdf">Best Practice Guidelines</a>.</p>

<p>We will vigorously investigate allegations of publication misconduct in PLOS journals (both before and after publication) and reserve the right to contact authors’ institutions, funders or regulatory bodies if needed. If we find conclusive evidence of misconduct we will take steps to correct the scientific record, which may include issuing a correction or retraction.  PLOS journals have a Journal Ethics Committee composed of representatives of all the journals, which sets ethical policies for PLOS journals and also investigates specific issues.</p>

<p>The following list outlines some key issues in Publication Ethics. It is not an exhaustive list. For further details authors should consult the journals’ specific policies and the references below.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Authors are expected to be aware of, and comply with, best practice in publication ethics specifically with regard to authorship (for example avoidance of ghost or guest authorship), dual submission, plagiarism, manipulation of figures, competing interests and compliance with policies on research ethics </li>
  <li>
  PLOS has incorporated CrossCheck (<a href="http://www.crossref.org/crosscheck.html">http://www.crossref.org/crosscheck.html</a>), powered by iThenticate, into its journal-wide submission system in order to screen submitted content for originality before publication. Each PLOS journal undertakes screening on a proportion of submitted papers. Authors will be contacted if needed following the screening process.
  </li>
   <li>Reviewers and Editors are required to treat manuscripts fairly and in confidence, and to declare any competing interests.</li>
</ul>

<p>In cases of suspected or alleged misconduct, the COPE flowcharts will be followed. We may also seek advice on specific cases at the COPE forum.</p>

<p>Any concerns about the above should be addressed to the Editor in Chief, Chief Editor, or Executive Editor as appropriate of the respective PLOS journal. Please direct inquiries to these individuals via the respective journal address.</p>

<a name="blogs"></a>
<h2>15.  Blogs, Wikis, Embargoes, and the Media</h2>
<p>Authors may present and discuss their findings ahead of publication: at medical or scientific conferences,
  on preprint servers, in public databases, and in blogs, wikis, tweets, and other informal communication channels.
  We recommend, however, that authors not contact the media or respond to such contact unless an article has been accepted for
  publication and an embargo date has been established. Respect for press embargoes will help to ensure that the work is
  reported accurately in the popular media and that the full peer-reviewed paper is freely available to any interested reader
  when the news item is published. However, if a journalist has covered a piece of work ahead of publication, this will not
  affect consideration of the work for publication. See also our <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/everyone/media/">embargo guidelines for journalists
    and scientists</a>.</p>

<a name="dual"></a>
<h2>17.  Biosecurity and Dual Use Research of Concern</h2>
<p>PLOS recognizes that certain research may fall into the category of "dual use research of concern". This is defined by the NSABB as any "biological research with legitimate scientific purpose that may be misused to pose a biologic threat to public health and/or national security." As an Open Access publisher, PLOS remains committed to the widespread dissemination of research while being sensitive to the issues of responsible publication standards. We expect that the potential risks of publishing a scientific paper will outweigh the benefits in only the rarest circumstances. On occasion, PLOS reserves the right to consider manuscript submissions within this context. In addition to the usual scientific scrutiny, such submissions may also be referred to an internal PLOS Dual Use Committee for further deliberation. Authors submitting to any PLOS journal are obligated to disclose potential bioethics/dual use concerns to the journal office at the time of initial submission.</p>
