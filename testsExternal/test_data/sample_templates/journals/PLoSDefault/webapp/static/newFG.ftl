<h2>1. Policies</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
As part of the process of making scientific and medical literature openly accessible on the Web, PLOS uses a streamlined production process that takes authors' submitted figures and tables straight to the formatting stage. PLOS does not provide graphics services. Although we provide guidelines and advice, <i>figure and table preparation is the author's responsibility.</i>
</p>

<p>
Please read the following guidelines carefully and thoroughly. Failure to comply with these guidelines can result in lower-quality published figures or inaccurate table layout, and/or prolonged publishing time of your article. 
</p>

<h3>Copyright and the Open Access Licenses</h3>
<p>
<i>Please do not submit any figures, photos, or tables that have been previously copyrighted unless you have and can supply written permission from the copyright holder to publish under the CC-BY or CC0 license.</i> </p>

<p>
Authors should read about <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC-BY</a> or <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/">CC0</a> before submitting papers.</p>

<p>
Papers authored by non-US government, non-WHO employees: Figures and photographic images in PLOS articles from authors who are not employed by the US government are published under an open access Creative Commons license (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC-BY</a>). Under the terms of this license, authors retain ownership of the copyright of their articles. However, the license permits any user to download, print out, extract, reuse, archive, and distribute the article, so long as appropriate credit is given to the authors and source of the work. This license ensures that the authors' article will be available as widely as possible and that the article can be included in any scientific archive. </p>

<p>
The statement reads: "Copyright: &copy; 20XX Authorlastname et al. This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited." </p>

<p>
<b>Papers authored by US government employees:</b> Figures and photographic images in papers authored by one or more US government employee are not copyrighted, but are licensed under a Creative Commons public domain license (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/">CC0</a>), which allows unlimited distribution and reuse of the article's contents for any lawful purpose. </p>

<p>
The statement reads: "This is an open-access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose. The work is made available under the Creative Commons CC0 public domain dedication." </p>

<p>
<b>Papers authored by WHO employees:</b> The following standard statement will be used in place of copyright or open-access statement for papers that have been authored by one or more WHO employees: </p>

<p>

<p>
<h3>Image Manipulation</h3>

<p>
Submitted image files should not be manipulated or adjusted in any way that could lead to misinterpretation of the information present in the original image. Inappropriate manipulation includes but is not limited to: 
<ul>
<li>The introduction, enhancement, movement, or removal of specific feature(s) within an image</li>
<li>Unmarked grouping of images that should otherwise have been presented separately (for example, from different parts of the same gel, or from different gels, fields, or exposures)</li>
<li>Adjustments of brightness, contrast, or color balance that obscure, eliminate, or misrepresent any information</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Digital images in manuscripts nearing acceptance for publication may be scrutinized for any indication of improper manipulation. If evidence is found of inappropriate manipulation we reserve the right to ask for original data and, if that is not satisfactory, we may decide not to accept the manuscript. </p>

<p>
A sample of provisionally accepted papers is randomly selected by <i>PLOS Biology</i> for extensive checking of original images for evidence of inappropriate manipulation. <i>PLOS Medicine</i> will extensively check original images from all papers accepted for publication for evidence of inappropriate manipulation. When a paper is checked for this purpose, publication staff will request that all original photographic images be provided by asking the author to upload them to our FTP site. </p>

<blockquote>
We are grateful to staff at the <i>Journal of Cell Biology</i> (Rockefeller University Press) for their help in establishing these guidelines and procedures (<a href="http://www.jcb.org/misc/ifora.shtml#image_aquisition">http://www.jcb.org/misc/ifora.shtml#image_aquisition</a>). </blockquote>

<h3>Depictions of Humans</h3>
<p>
For papers that include identifying information, or potentially identifying information, authors must download the <a href="http://www.plosmedicine.org/static/plos_consent_form.pdf">Consent Form for Publication in a PLOS Journal</a> from our site, which the patient, parent or guardian must sign once they have read the paper and been informed about the terms of PLOS open-access license. (This license means that the images and text we publish online become available for any lawful purpose). Once authors have obtained the signed consent form, it should be filed securely in the patient's case notes and the article submitted to PLOS journal should include this statement indicating that specific consent to publication was obtained. "The patients in this manuscript have given written informed consent (as outlined in PLOS consent form) to publication of their case details.
