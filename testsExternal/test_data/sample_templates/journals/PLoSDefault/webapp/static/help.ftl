<h2>Navigation of PLOS Content</h2>
<p>We have designed the site to enhance access to and assessment of article content and data as quickly as possible. </p>

<p><b><u>Navigate the corpus</u></b><br/>
Content discovery can be laborious without robust tools to create a refined list of relevant articles customized for your changing needs.  We provide three components to assist you in this process: <b>search filters, abstract and figure previews, and custom saved search</b>. 
</p>

<ol>
<li><b>Search filters</b></li>

<p>We offer search filters for users to drill down into preliminary results and glean a more precise selection.  On the results page, you can create filters based on a set of facets and sub-facets to further refine the search.  Users can toggle back and forth between results by adding and clearing filters. We currently offer the following filters:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Journals</em></li>
<ul><li>PLOS ONE</li> 
<li>PLOS Biology</li>
<li>PLOS Medicine</li>
<li>PLOS Pathogens</li> 
<li>PLOS Computational Biology</li> 
<li>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</li>
<li>PLOS Hub for Clinical Trials</li> 
<li>PLOS Collections</li> 
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><em>Subject Areas</em></li>
<ul>
<li>Biology and life sciences</li>
<li>Medicine and health sciences</li>
<li>Physical sciences</li>
<li>Research and analysis methods</li>
<li>[additional taxonomic terms based on search]</li>
</ul>
</ul>


<ul>
<li><em>Authors</em></li>
<ul>
<li>[author listing based on search]</li>
</ul>
</ul>


<ul>
<li><em>Where my keywords appear</em></li>
<ul>
<li>Title</li>
<li>Abstract</li>
<li>Introduction</li>
<li>Body</li>
<li>Materials and Methods</li>
<li>Results and Discussion</li>
<li>Conclusions</li>
<li>Supporting Information</li>
<li>References</li>
</ul>
</ul>


<ul>
<li><em>Article Type</em></li>
<ul>
<li>Research Article</li>
<li>Review</li>
<li>Overview</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<li><b>Abstract and figure previews </b></li>
<p>While the default view of search results is in list form, they can also be displayed as “figures.”  With this setting, each article tile showcases a representative image, along with general information such as title, date published, author listing, etc.  Without leaving their search results, users can immediately preview the article by screening its abstract and complete set of figures or directly download the PDF.  </p>

<li> <b> Custom saved search </b></li>
<p> Once you have created a search on exact fields of interest, stay up-to-date with automatic notifications of the latest content that matches your request: email and RSS feed.  Users can directly subscribe to that particular RSS feed.  Or they can log in and save the search for email notifications.  </p>
</ol>

<p><b><u>Navigate the article</u></b><br/>
We designed the layout and functionality of our articles to help users quickly navigate the article across each of its components.
</p>

<ol>
<li><b>Metrics signposts </b></li>
<p>We offer at-a-glance Metrics Signposts at the top of every article to further support content discovery.  These numbers offer an up-to-date glimpse of the article’s reach since publication.  This data can inform your browsing experience and enable swift navigation based on the impact profile of interest.  We display a varied selection of metrics versatile to serve a variety of browsing modes, whether you are interested in a highly cited paper, highly shared paper, etc.</p>
<ul> <li> Views: the sum of PLOS and PubMed Central pageviews and downloads</li>
<li>Citations: the paper's citation count computed by Scopus  </li>
<li>Academic Bookmarks: the total Mendeley, CiteULike, and Connotea bookmarks</li>
<li>Social Shares: the sum of Facebook and Twitter activity</li>
</ul>

<p>Metrics Signposts are made up of a sub-set of ALM data.  For a more comprehensive view of article reach and impact, please use the full ALM suite of impact indicators displayed on the article Metrics tab.</p>

<li><b>Enriched article information across tabs</b></li>
<p> We display additional content for each article across article tabs, making it easy to see and use.  Users can navigate to the article's companion information:</p>
<ul> <li>About the Authors </li>
<li>Metrics</li>
<li>Comments</li>
<li>Related Comment</li>
</ul>

<li> <b> Persistent article navigation links</b></li>
<p> As you scroll down the article page, the article navigation links to the left of the main article text float down the screen, and indicate which section of the article you’re currently viewing. Clicking these links will jump you directly to the relevant article section. </p>

<a id="articleMetrics" name="articleMetrics"></a>
<h2>Article-Level Metrics</h2>
<p>The “Metrics” tab on each article provides information on online article usage, citations to the article, and other indicators of impact. The regularly updated data fall into the following categories:</p>
<ul>
  <li>citations</li>
  <li>article usage</li>
  <li>media and blog coverage about the article</li>
  <li>social tools for reference management as well as research recommendation and evaluation</li>
  <li>PLOS reader evaluation</li>
</ul>
<p>These are described in full on the journal ALM page.</p>

<h3>Article Usage</h3>
<p>Online “Article Usage” data, as recorded at PLOS sites, are available for all PLOS journals for all articles published from June 17, 2005 to present. The understanding of these data is not straightforward, and so we have provided detailed (technical) information and summary data tables. Newly published articles do not accumulate usage data instantaneously but require approximately 48 hours before data are shown.</p>
<p>PubMed Central (PMC) usage data for each article was introduced in January of 2010, and PLOS started displaying this data from Jan 2012. PMC counts the number of page views and PDF downloads of the article on their site. PMC sends their usage data to us once a month. As a result, articles may experience a lag with the display of PMC data (up to a month’s time). The total article usage data is an aggregate of PLOS and PMC usage, combined.</p>
<p>These sources have their own limitations and in addition, results may overlap between sources. Read more detailed information about article usage data.</p>

<a id="articleCitations" name="articleCitations"></a>
<h3>Article Citations</h3>
<p>Citations to the article are gathered from several sources including PubMed Central, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, and CrossRef.</p>
<p>These sources have their own limitations and in addition, results may overlap between sources. Read more detailed information about <a href="almInfo#citationInfo">article citation metrics</a>.</p>

<a id="crossrefCitation" name="crossrefCitation"></a>
<h4>Article Citations</h4>
<p>Other indicators of the impact of the article include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Social tools for reference management, recommendation, and evaluation: Twitter, Facebook, Mendeley, CiteULike, and Connotea</li>
  <li>Blog coverage: ResearchBlogging and Nature Blogs</li>
  <li>Non-scholarly references: Wikipedia</li>
  <li>PLOS reader evaluation: Comments/Notes/Star ratings on PLOS site</li>
</ul>
<p>More information about each of these indicators and their limitations can be found on our <a href="almInfo">Article-Level Metrics Information</a> page.</p>
<p>Please note that, excluding PLOS article usage and PLOS reader evaluation, the data reported is automatically generated via information supplied by each service. PLOS is not responsible (nor able to correct) any errors which originate with the third party concerned.</p>

<a id="relatedArticles" name="relatedArticles"></a>
<h2>Related Content</h2>
<p>The "Related Content" tab on each article provides links (and information) to additional content which may be related to this article. Among the sources listed, are links to blog posts citing each PLOS article; links to other PLOS articles or topic categories (in the case of PLOS ONE); links to automated searches on the web; and links to social bookmarking activity.</p>

<p>The tab provides links to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Related PLOS Articles: Links to articles from the same journal that were published together in relation to each other.</li>
  <li>Related Subject Categories: For <em>PLOS ONE</em> articles only, access to articles that share the same assigned topics. Authors are responsible for assigning topics when they submit articles to PLOS and may assign more than one topic to their paper.</li>
  </ul>

<a id="relatedBlogPosts" name="relatedBlogPosts"></a>
<h3>Related Blog Posts</h3>
<p>Provides links to blog posts citing each PLOS article via a number of blog aggregation services: <a href="http://researchblogging.org/" title="Bloglines">ResearchBlogging</a> and <a href="http://blogs.nature.com/" title="Nature Blogs">Nature Blogs</a>.* A link is also provided to blog posts that have linked to the article via a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trackback" title="Wikipedia | Trackback">trackback</a>.</p>
