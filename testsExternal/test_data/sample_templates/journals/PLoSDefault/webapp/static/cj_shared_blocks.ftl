<#assign open_access = '<p>PLOS applies the <a href="license" title="Creative Commons Attribution License">Creative Commons Attribution License</a> (CCAL) to all works we publish. Under the CCAL, authors retain ownership of the copyright for their article, but authors allow anyone to download, reuse, reprint, modify, distribute, and/or copy articles in PLOS journals, so long as the original authors and source are cited. No permission is required from the authors or the publishers.</p>'>

<#assign publication_charges = '<p>To provide open access, PLOS journals use a business model in which our expenses&mdash;including those of peer review, journal production, and online hosting and archiving&mdash;are recovered in part by charging a publication fee to the authors or research sponsors for each article they publish. The <a href="http://www.plos.org/publish/pricing-policy/publication-fees/">fees</a> vary by journal.</p>

<p>PLOS is committed to the widest possible global participation in open access publishing. To determine the appropriate fee, we use a country-based pricing model, which is based on the country that provides 50% or more of the primary funding for the research that is being submitted. Research articles funded by Upper Middle and High Income Countries incur our <a href="http://www.plos.org/publish/pricing-policy/publication-fees/">standard publication fees</a>. Corresponding authors who are affiliated with one of our <a href="http://www.plos.org/support-us/institutional-membership/members-list/">Institutional Members</a> are eligible for a discount on this fee. Such authors will be informed of the discount applicable after submission of their manuscript.</p>

<p>Fees for Low and Lower Middle Income Countries are calculated according to the <a href="http://www.plos.org/about/viewpoints/global-participation-initiative/">PLOS Global Participation Initiative</a> pricing program for manuscripts submitted after 9am Pacific Time on September 4, 2012 (this program is not retroactive). 
<ul>
<li>Group One: Countries from this <a href="http://www.plos.org/group-one-countries/">list</a> will not be charged for publishing
</li>
<li>Group Two: Countries from this <a href="http://www.plos.org/group-two-countries/">list</a> will be charged a flat $500
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Our fee waiver policy, whereby PLOS offers to waive or further reduce the payment required of authors who cannot pay the full amount charged for publication, remains in effect. Editors and reviewers have no access to whether authors are able to pay; decisions to publish are only based on editorial criteria.</p>'>

One of the authors should be designated as the corresponding author. It is the corresponding author\'s responsibility to ensure that the author list, and the summary of the author contributions to the study, is accurate and complete. If the article has been submitted on behalf of a consortium, all consortium members and affiliations should be listed after the Acknowledgments.</p>'>


<#assign references = '<p>Only published or accepted manuscripts should be included in the reference list. Papers that have been submitted but not yet accepted should not be cited. Limited citation of unpublished work should be included in the body of the text only as &ldquo;unpublished data.&rdquo; All &ldquo;personal communications&rdquo; citations should be supported by a letter from the relevant authors.</p>

<p>Style information:</p>

<ul>
<li>PLOS uses the numbered citation (citation-sequence) method and first five authors, et al.</li> 
<li>References are listed and numbered in the order that they appear in the text. </li>
<li>In the text, citations should be indicated by the reference number in brackets. </li>
<li>The parts of the manuscript should be in the correct order <em>before</em> ordering the citations: body, boxes, figure captions, tables, and supporting information captions. </li>
<li>Abstracts and author summaries may not contain citations.</li>
<li>Journal name abbreviations should be those found in the NCBI databases: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nlmcatalog/journals">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nlmcatalog/journals</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Because all references will be linked electronically as much as possible to the papers they cite, proper formatting of the references is crucial. For convenience, a number of reference software companies supply PLOS style files (e.g., <a href="http://www.refman.com/rmhome.asp">Reference Manager</a>, <a href="http://www.endnote.com/">EndNote</a>).</p>

<li>Species names should be italicized (e.g., <em>Homo sapiens</em>) and the full genus and species must be written out in full, both in the title of the manuscript and at the first mention of an organism in a paper; after that, the first letter of the genus name, followed by the full species name may be used. </li>
<li>Genes, mutations, genotypes, and alleles should be indicated in italics. Use the recommended name by consulting the appropriate genetic nomenclature database, e.g., <a href="http://www.genenames.org/index.html" title="HUGO">HUGO</a> for human genes. It is sometimes advisable to indicate the synonyms for the gene the first time it appears in the text.

Required for all Presubmission Inquiries are contact information for the corresponding author, a cover letter (as a separate file), and an abstract.</p>
 
<p>Responses to these inquiries are normally provided within one week. Responses may take longer if consultation between members of the editorial board is required.

<#assign cj_materials = '<a name="coverletter"></a>
<h3>Cover Letter</h3> 
<p>It is important that you include a cover letter with your manuscript. Please explain why this manuscript is suitable for publication in <em>${journal_name}</em>; why will your paper inspire the other members of your field, and how will it drive research forward? You are free to recommend a suitable Associate Editor to handle your submission; however, the editors reserve the right to contact an alternative&mdash;either from the board or a guest editor&mdash;if it is considered more appropriate. Please note that the cover letter will be available to the editors and to external peer reviewers as necessary, so be careful not to reveal anything of a confidential nature.</p>

<a name="authorstatus"></a>
<h3>Author Status</h3>
<p>It is the responsibility of the corresponding author to ensure that all authors are aware of and approve the submission of the manuscript, its content, authorship, and order of authorship. Confirmation of this action is required at submission of all manuscripts. </p>
<p>The involvement of any professional medical writer in publication must be declared. We encourage authors to consult the <a href="http://www.emwa.org/Mum/EMWAguidelines.pdf" title="View Guidelines">European Medical Writers\' Association Guidelines</a> on the role of medical writers. For all PLOS journals, the corresponding author must submit the manuscript, related files, and all required data and information. From the point of submission through to publication, all communication related to that manuscript will be directed to and received from the corresponding author only.</p>
<p><em>${journal_name}</em> bases its criteria for authorship on those outlined in the <a href="http://www.icmje.org/ethical_1author.html">Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals</a>, which are summarized below. The contributions of all authors must be described. Contributions that fall short of authorship should be mentioned in the acknowledgments.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Authorship credit should be based on
<ol>
<li> substantial contribution to conception and design, or acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data;</li>
<li> drafting the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content; and</li>
<li> final approval of the version to be published</li>
</ol>
Authors should meet conditions 1, 2, and 3.</p>
<p>When a large, multi-center group has conducted the work, the group should identify the individuals who accept direct responsibility for the manuscript (3). These individuals should fully meet the criteria for authorship defined above and editors will ask these individuals to complete journal-specific author and competing interests disclosure forms. When submitting a group author manuscript, the corresponding author should clearly indicate the preferred citation and should clearly identify all individual authors as well as the group name.</p>
<p>Acquisition of funding, collection of data, or general supervision of the research group, alone, does not justify authorship. All persons designated as authors should qualify for authorship, and all those who qualify should be listed. Each author should have participated sufficiently in the work to take public responsibility for appropriate portions of the content."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>PLOS journals follow the <a href="http://publicationethics.org/">COPE guidelines</a> covering changes in authorship. Please note that if any changes to the list of authors of a manuscript are necessary after the initial submission of a manuscript to a PLOS journal but before its publication, the corresponding author may be asked to provide written confirmation that all authors consent to the change(s). The journal also reserves the right to request written confirmation from all authors (including those added, removed, or moved in the author order). Such written consent may be required before the revised submission is sent to the editors. </p>
<a name="financialdisclosure"></a>
<h3>Financial Disclosure</h3>
<p>This section should describe sources of funding that have supported the work. Please include relevant grant numbers and the URL of any funder\'s Web site. Please also include this sentence: "The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript." If this statement is not correct, you must describe the role of any sponsors or funders, and amend the aforementioned sentence as needed.</p>


<a name="competing"></a>
<h3>Competing Interests</h3>
<p>The submitting author is asked at submission to declare, on behalf of all authors, whether there are any financial, personal, or professional interests that could be construed to have influenced the paper. The information entered here will appear in the published version, so please do not include the same in the manuscript file.</p>
<p>Reviewers are also asked to declare any interests that might interfere with their objective assessment of a manuscript. Any relevant competing interests of authors must be available to editors and reviewers during the review process and will be stated in published articles. Read more about PLOS\'s <a href="competing">Competing Interests Policy</a>.</p>


<a name="electronicformats"></a> 
<h3>Electronic Formats </h3>
<p>Our submission system supports a limited range of formats for text and graphics. The following file formats/types and manuscript information are required before submission. If you are concerned about the suitability of your files, please contact us at ${email}.</p>
<a name="textfiles"></a>
<h4>Manuscript and Table Files</h4>

<p>Articles can be submitted for review in DOC, DOCX, RTF, or PDF. Any articles that have been prepared in LaTeX will be accepted for review, but only in PDF format. After acceptance, only text files (RTF or DOC) of the revised manuscript and tables can be accepted for use in the production process. </p>

<h4>Math Equations and DOCX</h4>

<p>If your manuscript is or will be in DOCX and contains equations, you must follow the instructions below to make sure that your equations are editable when the file enters production.</p>
<p>If you have not yet composed your article, you can ensure that the equations in your DOCX file remain editable in DOC by enabling &ldquo;Compatibility Mode&rdquo; before you begin. To do this, open a new document and save as Word 97-2003 (*.doc). Several features of Word 2007/10 will now be inactive, including the built-in equation editing tool. You can insert equations in one of the two ways listed below.</p>
<p>If you have already composed your article as DOCX and used its built-in equation editing tool, your equations will become images when the file is saved down to DOC. To resolve this problem, re-key your equations in one of the two following ways.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Use MathType to create the equation. MathType is the recommended method for creating equations.</li>
<li>Go to Insert &gt; Object &gt; Microsoft Equation 3.0 and create the equation. </li>
</ol>

<p>If, when saving your final document, you see a message saying &ldquo;Equations will be converted to images,&rdquo; your equations are no longer editable and PLOS will not be able to accept your file.</p>


<a name="latex"></a>
<h4>LaTeX</h4>

<p>Articles prepared in LaTeX may be submitted in PDF format for use during the review process. After acceptance, however, .tex files and formatting information will be required as a zipped file. Please consult our <a href="latexGuidelines">LaTeX Guidelines</a> for a list of what will be required.</p>

<h4>Tables</h4>
<p>Tables must conform to our <a href="figureGuidelines">Guidelines for Figure and Table Preparation</a> and placed at the end of the article DOC or RTF file. Accepted LaTeX submissions only should have table files—which must also conform to these guidelines—uploaded individually into the online submission system.</p>

 <a name="figurefiles"></a>
<h4>Figure Files</h4>
<p>For the article to be accepted for publication, the author will need to supply high-resolution versions of the figures in TIF or EPS format only. When preparing your figures, please ensure that the files conform to our <a href="figureGuidelines">Guidelines for Figure and Table Preparation</a>. Please do <strong>not</strong> upload panels for a single figure separately (for example, Figure 1A, Figure 1B-1D, Figure 1E); each figure file should be a single montage of all panels. Queries can be sent to <strong>figures [at] plos.org.</strong></p>

<p>If you are uploading your files in EPS format, please use the &quot;create outlines&quot; option under the type menu in Illustrator so that all text and fonts appear as intended in print. If you need additional help with figure preparation, please contact <strong>figures [at] plos.org</strong>.</p>

<p>PLOS does not accept vector EPS figures generated using LaTeX. We only accept LaTeX generated figures in TIFF format. Export your LaTeX files as PDFs, and then open them in GIMP or Photoshop and save as TIFF. In general, Figures must be generated in a standalone graphics application such as Adobe Illustrator, InkScape, PyMol, MatLab, SAS, etc. Please see our <a href="figureGuidelines" title="Go to Figure Guidelines">Figure Guidelines</a> for more information.</p>

<p>All figures will be published under a <a href="license" title="View license">Creative Commons Attribution License</a>, which allows them to be freely used, distributed, and built upon as long as proper attribution is given.  Please do not submit any figures that have been previously copyrighted unless you have express written permission from the copyright holder to publish under the CCAL license. </p>

<a name="supportinginfo"></a>
<h4>Multimedia Files and Supporting Information</h4>
<p>We encourage authors to submit essential supporting files and multimedia files along with their manuscripts. All supporting material will be subject to peer review, and should be smaller than 10 MB in size because of the difficulties that some users will experience in loading or downloading files of a greater size.</p>

<p>Supporting files should fall into one of the following categories: Dataset, Figure, Table, Text, Protocol, Audio, or Video. All supporting information should be referred to in the manuscript with a leading capital S (e.g., Figure S4 for the fourth supporting information figure). The numbered title and caption for each supporting information file should be included in the main article file, after the titles and captions for the main figures.</p>

<p>Supporting files will not be included in the typeset PDF, but will be referenced in the text and hosted online.</p>

<p>Supporting files may be submitted in a variety of formats, but should be publication-ready, as these files are not copyedited. Carefully consider whether your supporting information needs to be searchable and/or editable, and choose the most suitable format accordingly. See the <a href="figureGuidelines#multimedia">Figure Guidelines</a> for more detail about our requirements for multimedia files and the file formats we accept.</p>
        
<a name="readytosubmit"></a>
<h3> Ready to Submit Your Manuscript?</h3>

<p>We have provided a <a href="checklist" title="View submission checklist">Submission Checklist</a> to help you prepare your materials for submission and to make the online submission process as straightforward as possible. Please take the time to look through the list before submitting your article.  </p>

<p>Please login or register at our <a href="${jms_link}" title="Go to Submission site">online submission system</a> to begin the submission process. Files can be uploaded individually or together in a single ZIP file, and are automatically combined into a single PDF file, which must be approved by the author at the end of the submission process.  This merged PDF is for internal and external peer review only. Original source files will be used to prepare accepted articles for publication.</p>'>

<#assign cj_production_process = '<p>Before formal acceptance of the article for publication, the manuscript and all related files will be checked by PLOS staff to ensure that they comply with all essential formatting and manuscript preparation requirements. Please note that manuscripts are not subject to detailed copyediting. Therefore, please carefully review your manuscript, paying special attention to spelling, punctuation, and grammar, as well as scientific content. Authors who believe their manuscripts would benefit from in-depth professional copyediting are encouraged to use language-editing and copyediting services, such as the ones offered below (in alphabetical order): </p>

<#--Reviewer Guidelines - global_common-->

<#assign editing_reviewers_reports = '<p>The editors and PLOS staff do not edit any comments made by reviewers that are intended to be read by the authors unless the language is deemed inappropriate for professional communication or the comments contain information considered confidential. Such remarks should be reserved for the confidential section of the review form, which is intended to be read by the editors only. In their comments to authors, reviewers are encouraged to be honest but not offensive in their language. On the other hand, authors should not confuse frank and perhaps even robust language with unfair criticism.</p>'>

<#assign reviewers_competing_interests = '<p>As far as possible we respect requests by authors to exclude reviewers whom they consider to be unsuitable. We also, as much as possible, try to rule out those reviewers who may have an obvious competing interest, such as those who may have been collaborators on other projects with the authors of the manuscript under review, those who may be direct competitors, those who may have a known history of antipathy with the author(s), or those who might profit financially from the work. Because it is not possible for all such competing interests to be known by a particular editor, we request that reviewers who recognize a potential competing interest inform the editors or journal staff and recuse themselves if they feel that are unable to offer an impartial review.</p>
 
<p>Read more about PLOS\'s <a href="competing" title="PLOS policy regarding competing interests">Competing Interests Policy.</a> When submitting your review you must indicate whether or not you have any competing interests.</p>
 
<p>Occasionally, reviewers may be asked to offer their opinion on a manuscript that they may have reviewed for some other journal. This is not in itself a competing interest. That two journals have identified the same person as especially well qualified to judge the manuscript under consideration does not in any way decrease the validity of that opinion and may perhaps even enhance it.</p>'>

<#assign feedback_reviewers = '<p>We send reviewers’ comments along with the decision letter to all reviewers of that manuscript. If reviewers have identified themselves, this information will be passed on to other reviewers. Reviewers who may have offered an opinion not in accordance with the final decision should not feel that their recommendation was not duly considered or their service not properly appreciated. Experts often disagree, and it is the job of the editorial team to make a final publication decision.</p>'>


<#assign sharing_reviews = '<p>PLOS publishes <a href="http://www.plos.org/journals/index.php" title="Publish with PLOS">several journals</a>. Occasionally, editors recommend after peer review that a particular article is more suitable for another PLOS journal. If the authors choose to pursue that option, we transfer the manuscript and the reviews to the other journal. We expect that reviewers for any PLOS journal are willing to have their reviews considered by the editors of another PLOS journal.</p>'>

<#--Reviewer Guidlines - cj_common-->

<#assign cj_review_process = '<p>Submitted manuscripts are first reviewed by the <a href="eic">Editor-in-Chief</a> (EIC), Deputy Editor,  or one of the Section Editors, who may decide to reject the paper or send it on to an Associate Editor (AE) for further review. The AE is most often a member of the <em>${journal_name}</em> <a href="edboard">Editorial Board</a>, but occasionally a guest of the Board is invited to serve in this capacity. The AE evaluates the paper and decides whether it describes a sufficient body of work to support a major advance in a particular field.  If the AE does not judge the manuscript to be suitable for the journal, alone or in consultation with other editors, the manuscript may be rejected outright, without external peer review, with the reasons outlined in the decision letter. If the AE does judge the manuscript to be suitable for the journal, it will then be subject to external peer review.</p>
<p>The opinions of up to 5 experts are sought to evaluate the manuscript fully with respect to its significance, relevance, quality, and clarity.  On receipt of all reviewer comments, AEs, in consultation with other members of the Board and with the Editor-in-Chief or Deputy Editor, weigh all comments before rendering a decision.  </p>

<p>Based on the review comments and potentially further consultation amongst other editors, a decision is rendered by the AE and co-signed by the EIC, Deputy, or one of the Section Editors, who will send the decision to the corresponding author.</p>

<p>Possible decisions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reject</li>
<li>Major Revision</li>
<li>Minor Revision</li>
<li>Accept</li>
</ul>

<p>If reviewers appear to disagree fundamentally, the editors may choose to share all the reviews with each of the reviewers and by this means elicit additional comments that may help to make a decision. The editor may also choose to consult with other editors on the Board. That said, although the reviewers\' comments and opinions on the manuscript are very important, decisions are not necessarily made according to majority rule. Instead, the editors evaluate the recommendations and comments of the reviewers alongside comments by the authors and material that may not have been made available to those reviewers. The decision, along with the full set of review comments, is shared with the reviewers after a decision has been made.</p>
 
<p>When a paper has been revised in response to the review, or when authors appeal against a decision, we often ask the reviewers to offer additional comments. We request that reviewers make themselves available to provide such follow-up advice. We are nevertheless aware that reviewers do not wish to be involved in extended discussions over papers, and our goal is to keep such consultations to a minimum while still allowing authors a fair hearing.</p>'>

<#assign cj_reviewer_selection = '<p>The selection of appropriate and responsive reviewers is paramount for the success of the review process. We decide on reviewers for a particular manuscript based on many factors, including expertise, reputation, specific recommendations of authors and academic editors, and the AE\'s own knowledge of a reviewer\'s past performance.</p>

<p>As part of our editorial procedure, we confer with potential reviewers before sending them manuscripts to review. Reviewers should bear in mind that even these initial messages or conversations contain confidential information, which should be regarded as such.</p>'>


<#assign cj_writing_the_review = '<p>The purpose of the review is to provide the editors with an expert opinion regarding the significance, quality, relevance, and clarity of the manuscript under consideration, based on the <a href="reviewerGuidelines#criteria">Criteria for Publication</a>. The review should also supply authors with explicit feedback on how to improve their papers so that they are acceptable for publication in <em>${journal_name}</em>.</p>

<p>Although reviewers are welcome to make a particular recommendation for a manuscript\'s suitability for publication, they should do so with the understanding that other reviewers may offer other opinions. To assist the AEs and Editor-in-Chief or Deputy Editor who often must weigh disparate comments to arrive at a balanced decision, the reviewer should provide the editors with as much information as possible. A review that clearly outlines reasons both for and against publication is often of as much or even more value as one that makes a direct recommendation.</p>

<p>Although confidential comments to the editors are respected, any remarks that might help to strengthen the paper should be directed to the authors themselves. </p>

<p>The best possible review of a Research Article would answer the following questions:</p>

<ul>
        <li>What are the main claims of the paper and how significant are they? Is this paper important in its discipline? </li>
        <li>Have the authors provided adequate proof for their claims?</li>
        <li>Are these claims novel? If not, please specify papers that weaken the claims of originality of this one. </li>
        <li>Would additional work improve the paper? How much better would the paper be if this work were performed and how difficult would it be to do this work? </li>
        <li>Are the claims properly placed in the context of the previous literature? Have the authors treated the literature fairly?</li>
        <li>Do the data and analyses support the claims? If not, what other evidence is required?</li>
        <li>Are original data deposited in appropriate repositories and accession/version numbers provided for genes, proteins, mutants, diseases, etc.?</li>
        <li>Does the study conform to any <a href="policies#reporting">relevant guidelines</a> such as CONSORT, MIAME, QUORUM, STROBE, and the <a href="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/About-us/Publications/Reports/Biomedical-science/WTD003208.htm">Fort Lauderdale agreement</a>?</li>
        <li>Are details of the methodology sufficient to allow the experiments to be reproduced? </li>
        <li>Is any software created by the authors freely available? </li>
        <li><em>${journal_name}</em> encourages authors to publish detailed protocols and algorithms as supporting information online. Do any particular methods used in the manuscript warrant such treatment?</li>
        <li>Is the manuscript well organized and written clearly enough to be accessible to non-specialists? Would you recommend the author seek the services of a professional science writer?<sup>*</sup></li>
        <li>Have any parts of the paper been published elsewhere? Are there any copyright issues associated with this that conflict with PLOS license?<sup>*</sup></li>

<h2>1.  Copyright and License Policies</h2> 
<p>Upon submission of an article, authors are asked to indicate their agreement to abide by an open-access license. The license permits any user to download, print out, extract, archive, and distribute the article, so long as appropriate credit is given to the authors and source of the work. The license ensures that your article will be as widely available as possible and that your article can be included in any scientific archive.</p>

<p>Upon publication, PLOS also deposits all articles in <a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/" title="PubMed Central">PubMed Central</a>.  This complies with the policies of funding agencies, such as the <a href="http://publicaccess.nih.gov/" title="NIH">NIH</a> in the USA, the <a href="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/node3302.html" title="Wellcome Trust">Wellcome Trust</a> and the <a href="http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/access/" title="Research Councils in the UK">Research Councils</a> in the UK, and the <a href="http://www.dfg.de/en/news/information_science_research/other_news/info_wissenschaft_04_06.html" title="Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft">Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</a> in Germany, which request or require deposition of the published articles that they fund into publicly available databases.</p>

<p>Please read about the <a href="license" title="Creative Commons Attribution License">Creative Commons Attribution License</a> before submitting your paper.</p>

<a name="publication"></a>
<h2>2. Publication Charges</h2>
<p>To provide open access, PLOS journals use a business model in which our expenses&mdash;including those of peer review, journal production, and online hosting and archiving&mdash;are recovered in part by charging a publication fee to the authors or research sponsors for each article they publish. The <a href="http://www.plos.org/publish/pricing-policy/publication-fees/">fees</a> vary by journal.</p>

<p>PLOS is committed to the widest possible global participation in open access publishing. To determine the appropriate fee, we use a country-based pricing model, which is based on the country that provides 50% or more of the primary funding for the research that is being submitted. Research articles funded by Upper Middle and High Income Countries incur our <a href="http://www.plos.org/publish/pricing-policy/publication-fees/">standard publication fees</a>. Corresponding authors who are affiliated with one of our <a href="http://www.plos.org/support-us/institutional-membership/members-list/">Institutional Members</a> are eligible for a discount on this fee. Such authors will be informed of the discount applicable after submission of their manuscript.</p>

<p>Fees for Low and Lower Middle Income Countries are calculated according to the <a href="http://www.plos.org/about/viewpoints/global-participation-initiative/">PLOS Global Participation Initiative</a> pricing program for manuscripts submitted after 9am Pacific Time on September 4, 2012 (this program is not retroactive). 
<ul>
<li>Group One: Countries from this <a href="http://www.plos.org/group-one-countries/">list</a> will not be charged for publishing
</li>
<li>Group Two: Countries from this list <a href="http://www.plos.org/group-two-countries/">list</a> will be charged a flat $500
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Our fee waiver policy, whereby PLOS offers to waive or further reduce the payment required of authors who cannot pay the full amount charged for publication, remains in effect. Editors and reviewers have no access to whether authors are able to pay; decisions to publish are only based on editorial criteria.</p>

<a name="reviewer"></a>
<h2>3.  Reviewer and Editor Exclusions</h2>
<p>Upon submission of a manuscript, authors are asked if they wish to exclude any specific academic editors or reviewers from the peer review of their article. The editorial team will respect these requests so long as this does not interfere with the objective and thorough assessment of the article. See the relevant guidelines for reviewers and <a href="competing" title="PLOS policy regarding competing interests">more general information on PLOS’ policy regarding competing interests.</a></p>

<a name="sharing"></a>

<h2>4.  Sharing of Materials, Methods, and Data</h2>

<p>Publication is conditional upon the agreement of authors to make freely available any materials and information described in their publication that are reasonably requested by others for the purpose of academic, non-commercial research.</p>

<h3>Data Availability</h3>

<p>PLOS is committed to ensuring the availability of data and materials that underpin any articles published in PLOS journals. We believe the ideal is that all data relevant to a given article and all readily replaceable materials be made immediately available without restrictions (whilst not compromising confidentiality in the context of human-subject research). </p>

<p>We appreciate, however, that this ideal is not yet the norm in all fields. We are therefore currently collaborating with a number of subject-specific initiatives in order to develop relevant policies. In the meantime, authors must comply with <a href="guidelines#accessionnumbers">current best practice in their discipline for the sharing of data via databases</a>: for example, deposition of microarray data in ArrayExpress or GEO; deposition of gene sequences in GenBank or EMBL; and deposition of ecological data in DRYAD. We encourage all authors to comply with <a href="policies#reporting">available field-specific standards for the preparation and recording of data</a>.</p>

<p>Failure to comply with this policy will be taken into account when publication decisions are made. We encourage researchers to contact journal editors if they encounter difficulties in obtaining data or materials from published articles.  PLOS reserves the right to post corrections on articles, to contact authors’ institutions and funders, and in extreme cases to withdraw publication, if restrictions on data/materials access come to light after publication.</p>
<ol>
<li>Data for which public repositories have been established that are in general use should be deposited before publication, and the appropriate accession numbers or digital object identifiers published with the paper.</li>
<li>If an appropriate repository does not exist, data should be provided as supporting information with the published paper. If this is not practical, data should be made freely available upon reasonable request.</li>

<li>The conclusions of a study must not be dependent solely on the analysis of proprietary data. If proprietary data were used to reach a conclusion, and the authors are unwilling or unable to make these data public, then the paper must include an analysis of public data that validates the conclusions so that others can reproduce the analysis and build on the findings.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that any restrictions on the availability or on the use of datasets might be judged to diminish the significance of a paper and will therefore influence the decision about whether a paper should be published. These policies have been developed in accordance with the principles established in <a href="http://www.nap.edu/books/0309088593/html/" title="Sharing Publication-Related Data and Materials (National Academies Press, 2003)"><em>Sharing Publication-Related Data and Materials</em></a> (National Academies Press, 2003).</p>

<h3>Software/Algorithm Sharing</h3>

  <p>If new software or a new algorithm represents a significant
  part of a journal article, the authors must provide sufficient
  information to allow interested users to reproduce and build on
  the authors\' work. <strong>This implies that wherever possible
  all relevant materials be freely available and preferably
  accessible through public archives, open source repositories and
  the like</strong>. Software can be provided under license where
  necessary, but any restrictions on the availability or on the use
  of materials will be judged to diminish the significance of a
  paper and therefore might influence the decision about whether a
  paper should be published subject to those conditions. These
  policies have been developed in accordance with the principles
  established in <a href="http://www.nap.edu/books/0309088593/html/" title="Sharing Publication-Related Data and Materials (National Academies Press, 2003)"><em>Sharing Publication-Related Data and Materials</em></a>
  (National Academies Press, 2003).</p>

<a name="reporting"></a>
<h2>5.  Reporting Guidelines for Specific Study Designs</h2>

<p>You must check the <a href="http://www.equator-network.org">EQUATOR Network</a> site for any reporting guidelines that apply to your particular study design and ensure you include any required supporting information recommended by the relevant guidelines.</p>

<a name="clinical_trials"></a>
<h3>a. Clinical Trials</h3> 
<p> We follow the WHO definition of a clinical trial. See <a href="http://www.who.int/ictrp/en/">http://www.who.int/ictrp/en/</a>.</p>
<p>&quot;A clinical trial is any research study that prospectively assigns human participants or groups of humans to one or more health-related interventions to evaluate the effects on health outcomes. Interventions include but are not restricted to drugs, cells and other biological products, surgical procedures, radiologic procedures, devices, behavioural treatments, process-of-care changes, preventive care, etc&quot;</p>
<p>PLOS supports the position of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) on trial registration. All trials initiated after 1 July 2005 must be registered prospectively in a publicly accessible registry (i.e., before patient recruitment has begun), or they will not be considered for publication. For trials initiated before 1 July 2005, all trials must be registered before submission to our journals. See the <a href="http://www.icmje.org/faq_clinical.html">ICMJE faq</a> on trial registration for further details. The WHO\'s list of approved registries is listed <a href="http://www.who.int/ictrp/network/primary/en/index.html">here</a>. </p>

 <p>Authors of randomized controlled trials must adhere to the CONSORT reporting guidelines appropriate to their trial design. Please check the <a href="http://www.consort-statement.org">CONSORT statement Web site</a> for information on the appropriate guidelines for specific trial types. Before the paper can enter peer review authors must: 1) name in the paper trial registry, trial registration number, and IRB and 2) provide a copy of the trial protocol and a completed CONSORT checklist as supporting files. The CONSORT flow diagram must be included as Figure 1. Any deviation from the trial protocol must be explained in the paper. Authors must explicitly discuss informed consent in their paper, and PLOS reserves the right to ask for a copy of the patient consent form. Information on statistical methods or participants beyond what is indicated in the CONSORT statement should be reported in the Methods section.</p>
 
 <p>PLOS supports the public disclosure of all clinical trial results, as mandated for example by the FDA Amendments Act, 2007. Prior disclosure of results on a public Web site such as clinicaltrials.gov will not affect the decision to peer review or acceptance of papers in PLOS journals.</p>

<!--Origin of text unclear -->
<!--<h3>Background</h3> 
<p>This section should describe clearly the rationale for the study being done. It  should end with a statement of the specific study hypothesis and/or study  objectives. </p>
<p>[For a clinical trial provide any trial identification numbers and names (e.g.  trial registration number, protocol number or acronym).] </p>

<h3>Methods and Findings</h3>

<ul>
<li>Describe the participants or what was studied (e.g. cell lines, patient group;  be as specific as possible, including numbers studied). </li>
<li> Describe the study design/intervention/main methods used. </li>
<li>  Describe what was primarily being assessed e.g. primary outcome measure and, if  appropriate, over what period. </li>
<li>  [If appropriate, include how many participants were assessed out of those  enrolled, e.g. what was the response rate for a survey.] </li>
 <li> [If critical to the understanding of the paper, describe how results were  analyzed, e.g. which specific statistical tests were used.] </li>
<li>  For the main outcomes provide a numerical result if appropriate (it nearly  always is) and a measure of its precision (e.g. 95% confidence interval). </li>
 <li> Describe any adverse events/outcomes or side effects. </li>
 <li> Describe the main limitations of the study. </li>
</ul>
 
<h3>Conclusions</h3>

<p>Provide a general interpretation of the results with any important  recommendations for future research.</p>

<p>We aim to  respond to presubmission inquiries within 2 working days. However, if  you do not receive a response in 1 week please contact Andrew Hyde on +44 1223  463330 or Joshua Eveleth on +1 415 624-1234 or email <strong>plosmedicine [AT] plos.org</strong></a>. </p> -->

<a name="systematic_reviews"></a>
<h3>b. Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses of Randomized Controlled Trials</h3>

<p>Reports of meta-analyses of randomized controlled studies should use the QUOROM 
statement as a guide (Moher D, Cook DJ, Eastwood S, Olkin I, Rennie D, Stroup DF [1999] 
Improving the quality of reports of meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials: The QUOROM statement. 
Lancet354: 1896–900), and should include a copy of the <a href="http://www.consort-statement.org/index.aspx?o=1345" title="QUOROM checklist">QUOROM checklist</a>. 
Authors must also state within the Methods section of their paper whether a protocol 
exists for their systematic review, and if so, provide a copy of the protocol as supporting information.
The journal supports the prospective registration of systematic reviews. Authors whose systematic review was
prospectively registered (e.g. in a registry such as <a href="http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/">PROSPERO</a>) should also provide the registry number in their abstract. 
Registry details and protocols will be made available to editors and reviewers, and included alongside the paper for readers 
if the report is ultimately published.</p> 

<a name="diagnostic_studies"></a>
<h3>c. Diagnostic Studies</h3>

<p>Reports of studies of diagnostic accuracy should conform to the <a href="http://www.stard-statement.org/" title="STARD requirements">STARD requirements</a>.</p>

<a name="epidemiological_studies"></a>
<h3>d. Epidemiological Studies</h3>

<p>For reports of epidemiological studies, you should consult the <a href="http://www.strobe-statement.org" title="STROBE initiative">STROBE initiative</a>.</p>

<a name="microarray_experiments"></a>
<h3>e. Microarray Experiments</h3>

<p>Reports of microarray experiments should conform to <a href="http://www.mged.org/Workgroups/MIAME/miame.html" title="MIAME guidelines">the MIAME guidelines</a>, and the data from the experiments must be deposited in a publicly accessible database.</p>

<h3>f. Checklists for Biological and Biomedical Research Investigations</h3>
<p>We recommend authors refer to the MIBBI Portal (<a href="http://www.mibbi.org/index.php/MIBBI_portal">Minimum Information for Biological and Biomedical Investigations</a>) for prescriptive checklists for reporting biological and biomedical research where applicable. </p>


<a name="human"></a>
<h2>6.  Human and Animal Research</h2>
<p>All research involving human participants must have been approved by the authors’ institutional review board or equivalent committee(s) and that board must be named by the authors in the manuscript. For research involving human participants, informed consent must have been obtained (or the reason for lack of consent explained, e.g. the data were analyzed anonymously) and all clinical investigation must have been conducted according to the principles expressed in the <a href="http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/b3/index.html" title="Declaration of Helsinki"><em>Declaration of Helsinki</em></a>. Authors should submit a statement from their ethics committee or institutional review board indicating the approval of the research. We also encourage authors to submit a sample of a patient consent form and may require submission of completed forms on particular occasions.</p>


<p>For studies involving humans categorized by race/ethnicity, age, disease/disabilities, religion, sex/gender, sexual orientation, or other socially constructed groupings, authors should, as much as possible,</p>
<ul>
<li>make explicit their methods of categorizing human populations; </li>
<li>define categories in as much detail as the study protocol allows; </li>
<li>justify their choices of definitions and categories, including for example whether any rules of human categorization were required by their funding agency;</li>
<li>explain whether (and if so, how) they controlled for confounding variables such as socioeconomic status, nutrition, environmental exposures, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, outmoded terms and potentially stigmatizing labels should be changed to more current, acceptable terminology. Examples: &quot;Caucasian&quot; should be changed to &quot;white&quot; or &quot;of [Western] European descent&quot; (as appropriate); &quot;cancer victims&quot; should be changed to &quot;patients with cancer&quot;.</p>

<h3>Reporting of Animal Studies and Ethical Treatment of Animals</h3>
<p>For studies involving animals, all work must have been conducted according to relevant national and international guidelines.  Prior approval must have been obtained for all protocols from the author&apos;s institutional or other relevant ethics committee and the institution name and permit numbers provided at submission (see example below). For research involving non-human primates, all studies must be performed in accordance with the recommendations of the Weatherall report, &quot;<a href="http://www.acmedsci.ac.uk/images/project/nhpdownl.pdf">The use of non-human primates in research</a>&quot;. Where unregulated animals are used or ethics approval is not required by a specific committee, the article should include a clear statement of this and the reasons why ethical approval is not required.</p>
<p>We also strongly encourage all authors to comply with the &quot;Animal Research: Reporting <em>In Vivo</em> Experiments&quot; <a href="http://www.nc3rs.org.uk/ARRIVE">(ARRIVE) guidelines</a>, developed by <a href="http://www.nc3rs.org.uk/">NC3Rs</a> to improve standards of reporting to ensure that the data from animal experiments can be fully scrutinised and utilised. Relevant information should be included in the appropriate section of the article (e.g. title, abstract, or method) as outlined in the guidelines. Please note that these guidelines can be applied to any area of bioscience research using laboratory animals.</p>
<p>Example of statement of ethical approval: <em>This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The protocol was approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of the University of Minnesota (Permit Number: 27-2956). All surgery was performed under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering.</em></p>
<p>Please note that where research may be confused as pertaining to clinical research, the animal model should also be noted in the title.</p>

<a name="nomenclature"></a>
<h2>7.  Nomenclature</h2>
<p>The use of standardized nomenclature in all fields of science and medicine is an essential step toward the integration and linking of scientific information reported in published literature. We will enforce the use of correct and established nomenclature wherever possible:</p>
<ul>
<li>We strongly encourage the use of <a href="http://www.bipm.org/en/si/" title="SI units">SI units</a>. If you do not use these exclusively, please provide the SI value in parentheses after each value.</li>
<li>Species names should be italicized (e.g., <em>Homo sapiens</em>).</li>
<li>Genes, mutations, genotypes, and alleles should be indicated in italics. Use the recommended name by consulting the appropriate genetic nomenclature database, e.g., <a href="http://www.genenames.org/index.html" title="HUGO">HUGO</a> for human genes. It is sometimes advisable to indicate the synonyms for the gene the first time it appears in the text. Gene prefixes such as those used for oncogenes or cellular localization should be shown in roman: v-fes, c-MYC, etc.</li>

<li>The Recommended International Non-Proprietary Name (rINN) of drugs should be provided.</li>
</ul>

<a name="prior"></a>
<h2>8.  Submission of Related Manuscripts</h2>
<p>When submitting an article, all authors are asked to indicate that they have not submitted a related or duplicate manuscript for publication elsewhere. If related work has been submitted elsewhere, then a copy must be included with the article submitted to PLOS. Reviewers will be asked to comment on the overlap between related submissions.</p>

<a name="competing"></a>
<h2>9.  Competing Interests</h2>
<p>Authors are asked at submission to declare whether they have any financial, personal, or professional interests that could be construed to have influenced their paper. Reviewers are also asked to declare any interests that might interfere with their objective assessment of a manuscript. Any relevant competing interests of authors must be available to editors and reviewers during the review process and will be stated in published articles. <a href="competing" title="PLOS policy regarding competing interests">Click here for more general information on PLOS’s policy regarding competing interests.</a></p>

<a name="scientific"></a>

<h2>10.  Scientific and Editorial Misconduct</h2>
<p>Scientific misconduct is defined by the <a href="http://ori.dhhs.gov/" title="Office of Research Integrity">Office of Research Integrity</a> as "fabrication, falsification, plagiarism, or other practices that seriously deviate from those that are commonly accepted within the academic community for proposing, conducting, or reporting research." In cases where there is a suspicion or allegation of scientific misconduct or fraudulent research in manuscripts submitted for review, PLOS reserves the right to pass along these manuscripts to the sponsoring or funding institution or other appropriate authority for investigation. Although PLOS recognizes its responsibility to ensure that the suspicion of misconduct has been addressed, we do not ourselves make such determinations. PLOS is also represented at the <a href="http://www.publicationethics.org.uk/" title="Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE)">Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE)</a> and will abide by its principles and rulings.</p>

<a name="corrections"></a>
<h2>11. Corrections and Additions</h2>

<p>Two kinds of Corrections can be posted directly to an article: Minor Corrections and Formal Corrections. Minor Corrections indicate small errors and clarifications to the article, whereas Formal Corrections are reserved for errors that significantly affect the utility or understanding of the article. Formal Corrections are also sent to PubMed Central and PubMed. In both cases, the decision to indicate a posting as a Minor or Formal Correction is the responsibility of PLOS staff.</p><p>See the guidelines on <a href="commentGuidelines#corrections" title="View How to Add and View Corrections">How to Add and View Corrections</a> for more details. It is also possible to send Formal Corrections requests directly to the journal editorial staff.</p>


<a name="confidentiality"></a>
<h2>12. Confidentiality</h2>
<p>Editors and reviewers are requested to treat all submitted manuscripts in strict confidence.</p>


<a name="embargoes"></a>
<h2>13.  Blogs, Wikis, Embargoes and the Media</h2>

<p>Authors are of course at liberty to present and discuss their findings ahead of publication: at medical or scientific conferences, on preprint servers, in public databases, and in blogs, wikis and other informal communication channels. We recommend, however, that authors not contact the media or respond to such contact unless an article has been accepted for publication and an embargo date has been established. Respect for press embargoes will help to ensure that your work is reported accurately in the popular media, and that the full peer-reviewed paper is freely available to any interested reader when the news item is published. If a journalist has covered a piece of work ahead of publication, this will not affect consideration of the work for publication. See also our <a href="http://www.plos.org/journals/embargopolicy.html" title="embargo guidelines for journalists">embargo guidelines for journalists</a>.</p>'>
