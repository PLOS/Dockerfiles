  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>

  <p>As part of the process of making scientific and medical
  literature openly accessible on the Web, PLOS uses a streamlined
  production process that takes authors' submitted figures straight
  to the formatting stage. Most importantly, PLOS does not redraw
  figures accepted for publication in articles. Therefore, figure
  preparation is the author's responsibility.</p>

  <p>Please read the following guidelines carefully and thoroughly.
  Failure to comply with these guidelines may result in
  lower-quality figures and prolonged publishing time of your
  article.</p>

<a name="ccal" id="ccal"></a>
  <h2>2. Creative Commons Attribution License</h2>

  <p>All figures and photographic images will be published under a
  <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/">Creative
  Commons Attribution License</a> (CCAL), which allows them to be
  freely used, distributed, and built upon as long as proper
  attribution is given. Please do not submit any figures or photos
  that have been previously copyrighted unless you have express
  written permission from the copyright holder to publish under the
  CCAL license.</p>

  <p>For license inquiries, e-mail <strong>license [at] plos.org</strong>.</p>

<a name="titles" id="titles"></a>
  <h2>3. Titles and Legends</h2>

  <p>Titles and legends (captions) for main figures (i.e., not
  Supporting Figures) should be included in the main article file,
  not as part of the figure files themselves. Figure legends do not
  need to be uploaded to the online system. Do not include author
  names or the article title within the figure files. Instead, list
  the following information for each figure at the end of the
  article file, after the references, but before any tables:</p>

  <div style="margin-left: 2em">
    <ul>
    <li>Figure number (in sequence, using Arabic numerals: Figure
    1, Figure 2, Figure 3, <em>etc</em><em>.</em>)</li>

    <li>Short title using a maximum of 15 words. The figure title
    should be bold type, using sentence case ending with a period
    (.). For example: <strong>Figure 1. Adaptation and its
    potential costs.</strong></li>

    <li>A detailed legend of 300 words maximum can follow the
    figure title. Each panel should be described in the legend (see
    <a href="/static/figureGuidelines#parts">Panel
    Labels</a>, below).</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

<p>For more detailed information on Legends, see <a href="guidelines#figurelegends">Author
  Guidelines: Figure Legends</a></p>

  <p><strong>Supporting Figures.</strong> If Supporting Information
  figures are going to be published with your paper, please include
  the captions in the article file.</p>

  <p><strong>Note</strong>: If at any point you have to change the numbering order
  of your figures, you must make sure that all figure captions
  correctly correspond with the figures.</p>

<a name="general" id="general"></a>
  <h2>4. General Considerations</h2>

  <p>There are two broad categories of figures in PLOS articles:
  (1) those publishing directly with the article and (2) Supporting
  Information figures.</p>

  <p>Supporting Figures are not published directly in the article;
  rather, a hyperlink to the figure is provided in the online
  version of the published article. Figures published as
  Supporting Information can be in any file format or dimension, as
  long as they are no larger than 10 MB.</p>

  <p>Provide a separate file for every figure in your manuscript,
  including Supporting Information figures. Figures should not be
  embedded in the main manuscript file. For example, if your
  manuscript has 10 figures, you would upload 10 individual
  files. Authors who prepared their articles using LaTeX should consult the relevant part of these <a href=latexGuidelines#figures" title="Go to LaTeX guidelines">guidelines</a>.
 </p>


<a name="software" id="software"></a>
  <h3>Recommended Graphics Software</h3>
  

  <p>Several graphics software packages are available to help you
  create high-quality graphics:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Adobe Photoshop</li>

    <li>Adobe Illustrator</li>

    <li>PowerPoint</li>

    <li>CorelDraw</li>

    <li>GIMP (freely distributed at <a href=
    "http://www.gimp.org/">www.gimp.org</a>)</li>
    <li>Inkscape (freely distributed at <a href="http://www.inkscape.org">www.inkscape.org</a>)</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Note: Microsoft PowerPoint</strong><br />
  PowerPoint is a presentation program, used to display
  information, normally in the form of a slide show. While it is
  not designed to create artwork for publication, there are simple
  workarounds that will allow you to submit your PowerPoint
  figures. Please see the <a href="#ppt" title="Go to PowerPoint FAQ">PowerPoint FAQ</a> at the end of these
  guidelines.</p>

  <p><strong>Note: Microsoft Word</strong><br />
  PLOS does not recommend using Microsoft Word to adjust image
  size. Microsoft Word automatically down-samples figures and
  embeds them in the document at 72 ppi, so the images may be at a
  lower resolution and quality than is acceptable. We require that
  figures be created at a minimum resolution of 300 ppi. Please see
  the <a href="#xlsdoc" title="Go to Excel and Word FAQ">Word FAQ</a> at the end of these guidelines.</p>

  <p><strong>Note: Microsoft Excel</strong><br />
  PLOS does not recommend Excel to make or adjust figures, except for charts, graphs, or histograms generated from cell data. It lacks the capability to manipulate figures that dedicated graphics applications (such as GIMP, Photoshop, or Illustrator) have. Other than creating charts, graphs, or histograms, Excel should be only be used to make tables. See <strong>Table Guidelines</strong> for more information on formatting tables. Please see the <a href="#xlsdoc" title="Go to Excel and Word FAQ">Excel FAQ</a> at the end of these guidelines.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Note: Microsoft Paint</strong><br />
  Microsoft Paint is incapable of creating files at higher than 96ppi resolution, so PLOS strongly recommends that you never use it in creating your figures. If you must, follow the guidelines below under <a href="#stataexport">Export from Stata</a>.
 
  <p><strong>Note: LaTeX</strong><br />

  PLOS does not accept vector EPS figures generated using LaTeX.
  We only accept LaTeX generated figures in TIFF format. Export
  your LaTeX files as PDFs, and then open them in GIMP and save as
  TIFF. In general, Figures must be generated in a standalone
  graphics application such as those listed above, or PyMol,
  MatLab, SAS, etc.</p>

  <h2>5. Figure Preparation</h2>

<a name="size" id="size"></a>  
  <h3>File Size</h3>
    <p>Individual figure files should not exceed 10 MB.
    If you are having trouble reducing the size of your files,
    refer to the section below titled <a href="#lzw">Reduce TIFF File Size with
    LZW Compression</a>.</p>
  

<a name="quality" id="quality"></a>
  <h3>Figure Quality</h3>
    <p>A figure that looks good on screen may not be
    at optimal resolution. Test your figures by sizing them to
    their intended dimensions (see <a href=
    "/static/figureGuidelines#quickref">Quick Reference:
    Dimensions</a>)
    and then printing them on your personal printer. The online
    version should look relatively similar to the personal-printer
    copy: it should not look fuzzy, jagged, pixilated, or grainy at
    the intended print size.</p>

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> The quality of your figures will be only as good as the
  lowest-resolution element placed in them. In other words, if you
  created a 72 ppi line graph and placed in it a 300 ppi TIFF, it will be upsampled, resulting in it looking blurred, jagged, or pixelated.</p>

<a name="format" id="format"></a>
  <h3>Figure Format</h3>
    <p>Figures for publication must only be submitted in high-resolution TIFF or EPS format. Some figure types
    should be submitted in TIFF only (see <a href="#types">Figure Types</a> below). If you have not made any annotations to your image, and you have a high-quality TIFF, there is no need to submit it embedded in an EPS, as there will be no increase in quality as a result. See <a href="#tiff">How To: Convert Other File Types to TIFF</a> below
    for more information on converting figure files to TIFF.</p>

<a name="mode" id="mode"></a>
<h3>Color Mode</h3>
  <p>Figures containing color should be saved in either Grayscale or RGB (millions of colors), rather than Indexed Color, CMYK or any other color space. Grayscale or RGB files should be saved with a bit depth of 8 bits per channel, not 16. Bitmap (monochrome) images are not acceptable.</p>

<a name="layered" id="layered"></a>
    <h3>Layered TIFFs</h3>
    <p>TIFF files with multiple layers are not an
    accepted format for figures. Please make sure you provide us
    with a flattened version of your file. To flatten a layered
    TIFF file, open your figure in Photoshop. From the menu bar
    select Layer/Flatten Image and save the file. See also
    <a href="#combination">Combination Figures</a>, below.</p>

    <p>Create your figures using a white
    background. If you create figures using a transparent
    background, the figures may not display well in the online
    format.</p>

<a name="lines" id="lines"></a>
    <h3>Lines, Rules, and Strokes</h3> 
    <p>Lines should be at least 0.5
    point and no more than 1.5 point in order to reproduce well in
    a PDF file or web format.</p>


<table cellspacing="0" style="width:100%">

        <tr>
          <td width="50%">

        </tr>
      </table>


<a name="whitespace" id="whitespace"></a>
    <h3>White Space</h3>
    <p>Each figure should be closely cropped to
    minimize the amount of white space surrounding it. PLOS
    recommends a 2 point white space border around each figure.
    Cropping figures improves accuracy when the figure is placed
    among other elements during production of the final published
    article.</p>

    <h3>Text within Figures</h3>
 
<a name="fonts" id="fonts"></a>
    <h4>Fonts</h4>
 

  <p>Figure text must be in Arial font, between 8 and 12 point.
  Make sure that the visual information is readable at the size you
  select.</p>

  <p>Figure text that requires a font family other than Arial (math
  symbols, etc.) must have the font information embedded in the
  figure file, or be converted to outlines. See <a href="#eps">Embed Fonts in EPS Files</a> and <a href="#outlines">Convert Text to
  Outlines</a> below for more information.</p>

<a name="parts" id="parts"></a>
    <h4>Panel labels</h4>

  <p>Multi-panel figures (those with parts A, B, C, and D) should be submitted as a single file that contains all parts of the figure. Label the figure itself with capital letters, Arial bold font, 12 points. Any TIFFs with layers must be flattened (see Combination Figures below.)</p>

  <h2>6. Figure Dimensions</h2>

  <p>Figures for publication will be sized to fit 1, 1.5, or 2
  columns of the final printable PDF of the article. Dimensions will also depend on the article type. Please follow
  the sizing recommendations below for your original submission to
  create high-quality, appropriately sized figures. See <a href="#types">Figure
  Types</a> below for descriptions and recommendations for line
  drawings, grayscale drawings, halftones, and combination
  figures. See
  below for sizing information.</p>

<a name="alignment" id="alignment"></a>
  <h3>Figure Alignment</h3>
  <p>Figures will be left-aligned on the page or
    column, so please design them accordingly.</p>

<a name="width" id="width"></a>
    <h3>Figure Width</h3>
  <p>Widths depend on article type layout and are listed in the tables below, but must be within the minimum of 3.27in/8.3cm wide and the maximum of 6.83in/17.35cm wide. Figures can have a maximum height of 9.19in/23.35 cm. If your figures have labels that are in 8 point type or if your figures are very detailed, it is recommended that your figure be created so that it will span two columns. Images will be published in a horizontal orientation, and cannot be rotated 90 degrees to have a vertical orientation. Please size your figure widths to one of the column sizes listed below.

  <h2>7. Figure Types</h2>

<a name="lineart" id="lineart"></a>
  <h3>Line Art</h3>

  <p>Line art has sharp, clean lines and geometrical shapes against
  a white background. Line art is typically used for tables,
  charts, graphs, and gene sequences. You can use a program like
  Illustrator to create high-quality line art. A minimum resolution
  of 300 ppi will maintain the crisp edges of the lines and
  shapes.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Format: TIFF or EPS</li>

    <li>Minimum Resolution: 300 ppi</li>
  </ul>

  <p><img src="/images/FigureGuidelines_cf59cea.jpg"></p>

<a name="grayscale" id="grayscale"></a>
  <h3>Grayscale</h3>

  <p>Grayscale figures contain varying tones of black and white.
  They contain no color, so grayscale is synonymous with "black and
  white." The gray scale is divided into 256 sections with black at
  0 and white at 255. Software for preparation of grayscale art
  includes Photoshop.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Format: TIFF or EPS</li>

    <li>Minimum Resolution: 300 ppi</li>
  </ul>

<a name="halftones" id="halftones"></a>
  <h3>Halftones</h3>

  <p>The best example of a halftone is a photograph, but halftones
  include any image that uses continuous shading or blending of
  colors or grays, such as gels, stains, microarrays, brain scans,
  and molecular structures. To prepare and manipulate halftone
  images, use Photoshop or a comparable photo-editing program.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Format: TIFF</li>

    <li>Minimum Resolution: 300 ppi</li>
  </ul>

  <p><img src="/images/FigureGuidelines_m5741cc1f.jpg"><img src="/images/FigureGuidelines_m2d6fb628.jpg"></p>

<a name="combination" id="combination"></a>
  <h3>Combination Figures</h3>

  <p>Combination figures contain two or more types of images, for
  example, a halftone figure containing text. You should embed the
  images, group the objects, or flatten the layers, and flatten
  transparencies before saving as TIFF at a minimum of 300 ppi.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Format: TIFF</li>

    <li>Minimum Resolution: 300 ppi</li>
  </ul>

  <p><img src="/images/FigureGuidelines_m4766831c.jpg"></p>

<a name="stereograms" id="stereograms"></a>
  <h3>Stereograms</h3>

  <p>Stereograms are figures with two almost identical pictures
  placed side by side which, when viewed through special glasses or
  a stereoscope, produce a three-dimensional image.</p>

  <p><img src="/images/FigureGuidelines_m4c9c5eb3.jpg"></p>

  <p>If you plan on submitting a stereogram as one of your figures,
  make sure this is clearly mentioned in the caption for the figure
  within the manuscript. Stereograms must be sized so that the
  centers of each of these images are 63 mm apart. Make sure that
  the stereogram figure is at the size you would like them to
  display. They will be checked prior to publishing, but this step
  will ensure your stereogram will be viewed properly.</p>

  <h2>8. Uploading Figures to PLOS Manuscript Submission System</h2>

  <h3>Upload Order</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Upload cover letter, then article file first. Ensure that
    it contains the figure legends, but not the figures
    themselves.</li>

    <li>Figures should be numbered in the order they are first
    mentioned in the text, and uploaded in the same order. For
    example, Figure 1 should be uploaded as the first figure file,
    Figure 2 the second, etc.</li>

    <li>Figures should be uploaded in the desired orientation.</li>

    <li>Multimedia files (.avi or .swf files) must be uploaded as a
    Supporting Information file type and not a figure. See
    <a href="#multimedia">Multimedia Files</a> below for more information.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><img src="/images/FigureGuidelines_m159e37b3.jpg"></p>

  <p>Note: When a figure is uploaded to PLOS manuscript
  submission system, a PDF file is created that contains the image
  but does not represent the final appearance of your figures in
  your published article. In addition, a "merged PDF" containing
  the article file and all of the figures is created automatically,
  which should be used by authors as a quick way to review their
  figures for egregious errors.</p>

<a name="multimedia" id="multimedia"></a>
  <h2>9. Multimedia Files</h2>

  <p>PLOS encourages authors to submit multimedia files that are crucial to the conclusions of the paper. We expect reasonable video quality and prefer 128 kbit/s AAC audio and 480p H.264 video in MPEG-4 (mp4) container. However, we accept video file formats: mov, avi, mpg, mpeg, mp4, mkv, flv and wmv. Preferred size limit of movies is 10Mb. If making the dimensions smaller or recompressing the movie  compromises the image quality or usefulness of the movie, we can accept the movie as is. These files are published as Supporting Information.
</p>

<h3>Video Players</h3>
<p>Videos must open and play in either QuickTime Player v. 7.6.2 or Windows Media Player v. 11. Preferably both, but as long as they play in one of these common players, the movie is acceptable. VLC (VideoLAN Client) is a cross-platform universal video player. VLC will play back most formats and codecs without the need to download additional software modules. VLC is free and GPL licensed. VLC offers many other features including streaming.</p>

<h3>Codecs</h3>
<p>A codec (which stands for compression-decompression) is a software module that contains algorithms used by encoding or playback software to encode or decode video and/or audio information. </p>

<p>Popular proprietary codecs include Windows Media Video and Quicktime. Open source video codec alternatives include x264 or the XviD codec. XviD is a high quality codec and is the most widely supported open source option available. It is relatively simple for most people to watch as many players have native support for XviD.
A great resource containing guides for encoding is <a href="http://www.videohelp.com">http://www.videohelp.com/</a>.</p>

<h3>Standards</h3>
<p>Videos compression standards, such as the MPEG1, MPEG2 and MPEG4 standards set by the Motion Picture Experts Group, are a set of rules that video codecs and formats must be designed to adhere to. The MPEG4 standard contains several parts including Advanced Simple Profile (MPEG4 Part 2) that contains elements implemented in codecs such as XviD, 3ivX, DivX, and H.264 (MPEG4 Part 10).</p>


<a name="manipulation" id="manipulation"></a>
  <h2>10. Image Manipulation</h2>

  <p>Image files should not be manipulated or adjusted in any way
  that could lead to misinterpretation of the information present
  in the original image. Inappropriate manipulation includes but is
  not limited to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The introduction, enhancement, movement, or removal of
    specific feature(s) within an image;</li>

    <li>Unmarked grouping of images that should otherwise have been
    presented separately (for example, from different parts of the
    same gel, or from different gels, fields, or exposures);</li>

    <li>Adjustments of brightness, contrast, or color balance that
    obscure, eliminate, or misrepresent any information.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Digital images in manuscripts nearing acceptance for
  publication may be scrutinized for any indication of improper
  manipulation. If evidence is found of inappropriate manipulation
  we reserve the right to ask for original data and, if that is not
  satisfactory, we may decide not to accept the manuscript.</p>

<p>A sample of provisionally accepted papers is randomly selected by <em>PLOS Biology</em> for extensive checking of original images for evidence of inappropriate manipulation. <em>PLOS Medicine</em> will extensively check original images from all papers accepted for publication for evidence of inappropriate manipulation. When a paper is checked for this purpose, publication staff will request that all original photographic images be provided by asking the author to upload them to our FTP site. </p>

  <p>We are grateful to staff at the <em>Journal of Cell
  Biology</em> (Rockefeller University Press) for their help in
  establishing these guidelines and procedures (<a href=
  "http://www.jcb.org/misc/ifora.shtml#image_aquisition">http://www.jcb.org/misc/ifora.shtml#image_aquisition</a>).</p>

  <h2>11. How To</h2>

<a name="ppt" id="ppt"></a>
<h3>Convert PowerPoint Files to High-Resolution TIFFs</h3> 
<p><strong>Caution:</strong> Do not add artwork to your PowerPoint slides by copying from another application and then pasting into PowerPoint. Your figures will be downsampled to screen resolution. Instead use Insert > Picture > From File.
</p>
<p><strong>Caution:</strong> Do not use File > Save as > TIFF. This will result in a low-resolution, poor-quality figure.</p>
<h4>Windows 98, XP, Vista and PowerPoint 2003 or 2007:</h4>
<p><strong>Step I: Convert PowerPoint File to PDF</strong></p> 
<p>First, you need to edit your registry as detailed here: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;827745">http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;827745</a>.
This is approved by Microsoft, so it’s completely safe to do. In step 8, the value you need to enter is 300.  </p> 

<p>Then, there are two possible ways to create PDFs from PowerPoint files: use the Adobe PDF menu in some versions of PowerPoint, or create a PDF via the Print command.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open your file in PowerPoint. From the Adobe PDF menu, select Change Conversion Settings. The PDFMaker Settings dialog displays. </li>
<li>From the Conversion settings dropdown menu, select Press Quality. Uncheck View Adobe PDF result. Click OK.</li> 
<li>From the Adobe PDF menu, select Convert to Adobe PDF. You will be asked to save the PDF file to a location of your choosing.</li> 
<li>Click OK.</li> 
</ol>

<p>– OR -</p>
<ol>
<li>Open your file in PowerPoint.</li>
<li>Select Print from the File dropdown menu.</li>
<li>Select the Adobe PDF (or similar driver) in the Printer Name window.</li>
<li>Click Properties. Change the Default Settings pull-down to Press Quality. Uncheck the "View Adobe PDF results" box if you don't want Acrobat to launch.</li>
<li>Click OK, then click OK. Pick where the PDF will be created, and click Save.
Note: If your PowerPoint file contains figures on multiple slides, print each slide to a separate PDF (if you do this, skip ahead to Step III). Alternately, you can create one PDF file and then use Adobe Acrobat to separate the figures/slides into individual files, as detailed in Step II.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Step II: Convert Multi-Page PDF File to Individual Files</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Using Adobe Acrobat Standard, open the PDF file that you created in Step 1. From the Document menu, select Pages and then Extract. The Extract Page dialog box displays.</li> 
<li>Enter the page numbers in the To and From fields and then select the Delete Pages checkbox. Checking this box will delete the page that you entered in the To and From fields from the PDF file.</li> 
<li>Click OK. The page that you specify in the previous step is now shown in Acrobat.</li> 
<li>From the File menu, select save and enter the file name (e.g., Figure 1) for the extracted page and then click OK.</li> 
<li>Repeat this process until a separate file is created for each figure/slide.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Step III: Convert Individual PDF Files to TIFFs</strong></p> 
<p>In Photoshop:</p>
<ol>
<li>File&#8594;Open the PDF. You will need to do this one page at a time. Make sure you're importing it at 300ppi, RGB.</li>
<li>Use the Crop Tool (fifth from the top of the toolbar) to select an area close to the borders of your image. Hit Enter to apply the crop.</li> 
<li>Layer&#8594;Flatten Image</li>
<li>Image&#8594;Image Size. Uncheck the Resample Image checkbox. If the Width is over 17.35cm, type 17.35 in the Width box (17.35cm is our maximum allowable width for figures). The Resolution will go up automatically as the Width decreases. If the resolution does not hit 300 when you make the Width 17.35, type 300 in Resolution and as long as Width doesn't go below 8.3cm, everything is fine. Also, the height cannot be more than 23.35. If the Height and Width are within these prescribed limits, no adjustment to your figure size needs to be made.</li>
<li>File&#8594;Save As. Save as TIFF, Image Compression set to LZW, Pixel Order set to Interleaved, Byte Order set to IBM PC.</li>
</ol>

<p>In GIMP:</p>
<ol>
<li>File&#8594;Open the PDF. You will need to do this one page at a time. Open pages as Images at 300ppi. Click Import.</li>
<li>Use the Crop Tool (third row, second from the right, looks like a knife blade) to select an area close to the borders of your image. Hit Enter to apply the crop.</li> 
<li>Image&#8594;Scale Image. Set the units of measurement, in the pull down menu next to Height, to millimeters. If the Width is over 173.5mm, type 173.5 in the Width box (17.35cm is our maximum allowable width for figures) and hit Tab. The new Height of the figure will appear, scaled proportionately to the change in Width. The Width cannot be below 83.0mm, and the height cannot be more than 233.5mm. If the Height and Width are within these prescribed limits, no adjustment to your figure size needs to be made.</li>
<li>File&#8594;Save As. Click the + sign next to "Select File Type (By Extension)". From the menu that appears, select TIFF. Click Save.  Set Compression set to LZW. If you're prompted about layers in the file, select Flatten Image.</li>
</ol>

<p>In Acrobat Pro:</p>
<ol>
<li>File&#8594;Open the PDF</li>
<li>If necessary, go Document&#8594;Rotate Pages to rotate the document to a horizontal orientation.</li>
<li>File&#8594;Save As. In the "Save as type" pull-down menu, select TIFF.</li>
<li>Click the Settings button on the right-hand side of the Save As dialog box. In the top third, under "File Settings", both Grayscale and Color should be set to LZW. In the bottom third, "Conversion," set Colorspace to Color:RGB, and Resolution to 300ppi. Click OK. Click Save.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> PDFs converted to TIFFs in this manner should still be opened in Photoshop or GIMP to crop excess white space, and make sure the figure falls within our maximums and minimums.</p>

<h4>Macintosh OS X and PowerPoint 2004:</h4>
<p><strong>Step I: Convert PowerPoint File to PNG</strong></p> 
<ol>
<li>Go to PowerPoint Preferences. Under the Save tab, at the bottom, set Advanced Resolution Settings to 1600 DPI.</li>
<li>File &#8594; Save As. In the Format pull-down menu, select PNG. Save. PNG is the only format you can export in at a high resolution – all other formats save as 72ppi no matter what you set in Preferences.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Step II: Convert Individual PNG Files to TIFFs</strong></p> 
<p>In Photoshop:</p>
<ol>
<li>File&#8594;Open the PNG.</li> 
<li>Use the Crop Tool (fifth from the top of the toolbar) to select an area close to the borders of your image. Hit Enter to apply the crop.</li> 
<li>Layer&#8594;Flatten Image</li>
<li>Image&#8594;Image Size. Uncheck the Resample Image checkbox. If the Width is over 17.35cm, type 17.35 in the Width box (17.35cm is our maximum allowable width for figures). The Resolution will go up automatically as the Width decreases. If the resolution does not hit 300 when you make the Width 17.35, type 300 in Resolution and as long as Width doesn't go below 8.3cm, everything is fine. Also, the height cannot be more than 23.35. If the Height and Width are within these prescribed limits, no adjustment to your figure size needs to be made.</li>
<li>File&#8594;Save As. Save as TIFF, Image Compression set to LZW, Pixel Order set to Interleaved, Byte Order set to IBM PC.</li>
</ol>

<p>In GIMP:</p>
<ol>
<li>File&#8594;Open the PNG. You will need to do this one page at a time.</li>
<li>Use the Crop Tool (third row, second from the right, looks like a knife blade) to select an area close to the borders of your image. Hit Enter to apply the crop.</li>
<li>Image&#8594;Scale Image. Set the units of measurement, in the pull down menu next to Height, to millimeters. If the Width is over 173.5mm, type 173.5 in the Width box (17.35cm is our maximum allowable width for figures) and hit Tab. The new Height of the figure will appear, scaled proportionately to the change in Width. The Width cannot be below 83.0mm, and the height cannot be more than 233.5mm. If the Height and Width are within these prescribed limits, no adjustment to your figure size needs to be made.</li>
<li>File&#8594;Save As. Click the + sign next to "Select File Type (By Extension)". From the menu that appears, select TIFF. Click Save.  Set Compression set to LZW. If you're prompted about layers in the file, select Flatten Image.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Macintosh OS X and PowerPoint 2008:</h4>
<p><strong>Step I: Convert PowerPoint File to PNG or PDF</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Go to PowerPoint Preferences. Under the Save tab, at the bottom, set Advanced Resolution Settings to 1600 DPI.</li>
<li>File &#8594; Save As. In the Format pull-down menu, select either PNG or PDF. Save. Your PNG will be oversize at 72ppi, but will resize properly to 300ppi in Photoshop or GIMP. Your PDF will be the exact size of your PowerPoint slide at 300ppi. All other formats save as 72ppi no matter what you set in Preferences.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Step II: Convert Individual Files to TIFFs</strong></p> 
<p>In Photoshop:</p>
<ol>
<li>File&#8594;Open the PNG or PDF.</li> 
<li>Use the Crop Tool (fifth from the top of the toolbar) to select an area close to the borders of your image. Hit Enter to apply the crop.</li> 
<li>Layer&#8594;Flatten Image</li>
<li>If you opened a PNG, go Image&#8594;Image Size. Uncheck the Resample Image checkbox. If the Width is over 17.35cm, type 17.35 in the Width box (17.35cm is our maximum allowable width for figures). The Resolution will go up automatically as the Width decreases. If the resolution does not hit 300 when you make the Width 17.35, type 300 in Resolution and as long as Width doesn't go below 8.3cm, everything is fine. Also, the height cannot be more than 23.35. If the Height and Width are within these prescribed limits, no adjustment to your figure size needs to be made.</li>
<li>If you opened a PDF, go Image&#8594;Image Size and check to make sure the PDF is within our dimension limits. Resize it down to fit within these limits if need be.</li>
<li>File&#8594;Save As. Save as TIFF, Image Compression set to LZW, Pixel Order set to Interleaved, Byte Order set to IBM PC.</li>
</ol>

<p>In GIMP:</p>
<ol>

<h4>OpenOffice (any operating system):</h4>
<p>The above procedures work equally well in OpenOffice as they do in Microsoft Office.</p>


  
<a name="eps" id="eps"></a>
  <h3>Embed Fonts in EPS Files</h3>

  <p>Always embed fonts or create outlines when creating
  EPS files. If your figures require special symbols or
  Greek characters the text may not reproduce properly unless you
  embed your fonts or create outlines of the text. See the <a href="#outlines">Convert
  Text to Outlines</a> below for more information.</p>

  <p>To embed fonts using Adobe Illustrator, open the EPS file.
  From the File Menu, select Save As. In the Save As dialog box,
  make sure that the Embed Fonts option is selected and click
  OK.</p>

<a name="outlines" id="outlines"></a>
  <h3>Convert Text to Outlines</h3>

  <p>When you convert text to outlines, the text is converted to a
  series of lines and fills. The reference to the font that was
  used to create the text is no longer present. This process makes
  it unnecessary for PLOS production department to have the
  original font used to create the figure text. This is to ensure
  that your figures published as you intended.</p>

<table cellspacing="0" style="width:100%">
    <col width="304">
    <col width="298">

    <tr valign="top">

        <p>Example of text that has been converted to outlines.
        Notice that every character is outlined.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>You can use Adobe Illustrator to convert text to outlines by
  selecting the text you want to convert. Then from the Type menu,
  select Create Outlines (Shift + Control + O on PC, and Shift +
  Command + O on Mac).</p>

  <p>If you do not convert text to outlines, when your figure is
  opened during the production process any text in a non-standard
  font will automatically be substituted for default font. This can
  cause the text in the figure to render incorrectly.</p>

  <p>Caution: You will not be able to change your text after it has
  been converted to outlines so make sure it is correct before
  converting.</p>

  <p>To find the resolution of a figure using
    Photoshop, first open the file. Then from the Image menu,
    select Image Size. The Image Size dialog box will open
    displaying the figure dimensions, document size and resolution.
    You can decrease the size of a file, but you should not
    increase the resolution and/or dimensions of a file to meet the
    journals requirements. Increasing the file sizes manually may
    result in poor quality figures.</p>
    
    <h4>Windows Explorer</h4>
    <p>To check the resolution of a figure file
    using Windows Explorer, locate and select the file. Right-click
    and select Properties. In the Properties dialog box, select the
    Summary Tab. If you do not see the properties of the figures,
    click Advanced. This will display all of the properties
    associated with the selected figure. Look at the Horizontal
    Resolution and Vertical Resolution to determine the figure
    resolution.</p>
  <h4>GIMP</h4>
    <p>To find the resolution of a figure using GIMP, first open the file. Then from the Image menu, select Scale Image. The Scale Image dialog box will open displaying the figure dimensions and resolution. You can decrease the size of a file, but you should not increase the resolution and/or dimensions of a file to meet the journals requirements.

<a name="stataexport" id="stataexport"></a>
<h3>Export from Stata</h3>
<p>Stata does everything at screen resolution (72ppi). So if you want to have a final figure that is 300ppi, and (for example) 10cm square, you would divide the target resolution (300) by the output resolution (72), and multiply the target dimensions by the quotient to get the dimensions you should export your figure at. Dividing 300 by 72 gives you a quotient of 4.16, so a 41.6cm (4.16 multiplied by 10) square image at 72ppi could be resized to 10cm square at 300ppi  in an application such as Photoshop or GIMP (<a href="http://www.gimp.org">www.gimp.org</a>) without any loss of image quality.  Be sure to save your TIFF with LZW compression turned on. Or save as a vector EPS.</p>

<h3>Exporting a High Resolution TIFF Using GeneSpring</h3>
<p>
<a href="http://www.chem.agilent.com/cag/bsp/products/gsgx/manuals/GeneSpring-manual.pdf">PDF Manual</a> Instructions began at page 84. To paraphrase, see Figure 4.2. Replace the 72 for "image resolution" with 300. 
Export As: This will export the current view as an Image, an HTML file
or the values as a text, if appropriate. See Figure 4.18
Export as Image: This will pop-up a dialog to export the view as an image. 
This functionality allows the user to export a very high quality image. 
You can specify any size of the image, as well as the resolution of the image by specifying the required dots per inch (dpi) for the image. 
Images can be exported in various formats. Currently supported formats include png, jpg, jpeg, bmp or tiff. 
Finally, images of very large size and resolution can be printed in the tiff format. 
Very large images will be broken down into tiles and recombined after all the images pieces are written out. 
This ensures that memory is but built up in writing large images. If the pieces cannot be recombined, 
the individual pieces are written out and reported to the user. However, tiff files of any size can be recombined 
and written out with compression. The default dots per inch is set to 300 dpi and the default size if individual pieces for 
large images is set to 4 MB and tiff image without tiling enabled. These default parameters can be changed in the 
tools -!Options dialog under the Export as Image.

<h2>12. Table Guidelines</h2>
<p>Tables submitted for publication should be included at the very end of the article file (.doc, .rtf, .tex).  Supporting Information tables should be submitted as separate files in any of the following formats (although authors should aim to ensure that the file type is most appropriate to the information displayed): Word (.doc), Excel (.xls), PDF, PPT, JPG, EPS, or TIFF.</p>
<h3>Title and Footnotes</h3>   
<p>Each table needs a concise title of no more than one sentence, placed above the table with the table number (e.g., Table 1).  The legend and footnotes should be placed below the table.  Footnotes may be used to explain abbreviations.</p>
<h3>Specifications</h3>   
<p>Tables that do not conform to the following requirements may give unintended results when published.  Problems may include the movement of data (rows or columns), loss of spacing, or disorganization of headings.  Note: Multi-part tables with varying numbers of columns or multiple footnote sections should be divided and renumbered as separate tables.</p>
<p>In the published version, tables will be formatted in PLOS style.  This includes alternate row shading, content left-aligned in cells, title above the table and legend/footnotes below the table.</p>
<h3>Tables <strong>must</strong>:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Be cell-based (e.g., created in Word with Tables tool (preferred) or in Excel).</li>
<li>Be editable (i.e., not a graphic object).</li>
<li>Have heading/subheading levels in separate columns.</li>
<li>Be no larger than one printed page (7 in x 9.5 in). Larger tables can be published as online supporting information. Note: some wide tables may be printed sideways in the PDF.</li> 
</ul>
<h3>Tables must <strong><em>not</em></strong>:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use returns or tabs within a cell.</li>
<li>Have color or shading.</li>
<li>Use lines, rules, or borders.</li>
<li>Contain spaces within cells to align text.</li>
<li>Have <em>vertically</em> merged cells; horizontally merged cells are fine.</li>
<li>Have inserted text boxes or pictures.</li>
<li>Have tables within tables.</li>
<li>Include empty columns, rows, or cells to create spacing.</li>
<li>Include hyperlinked text.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If your submitted table contains any of these elements, they will be returned for adjustments.</strong></p>
